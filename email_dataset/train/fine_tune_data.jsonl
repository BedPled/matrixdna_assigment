(i'm going to check with the control engineers in rheine to assure my interpretation of this is correct.) here are some documents that describe how the parameters/set points relate to individual faults. this document describes the faults in some detail: this document shows the nominal values of the parameters for all turbine types. (this is an \"unofficial\" version and my not match the parameter settings in the field exactly): this document describes the parameters in greater detail. (some of these are subject to interpretation so if we have questions about exactly what the parameters do we usually have to as the engineers in rheine for more details): i hope this helps. if you have further questions ask me. -garth"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Operational Trade & Flow Accounting"}]}

(as for \"offset,\" i have been under the impression that we have been using that term to describe a deduction that may validly be made from a refund amount that i am deemed to owe another party -- particularly, a deduction occasioned by that other party's unpaid bill from me.) presumably, each of us knows who sold power to us and the prices for those sales. therefore, should i so choose, i already have the ability to assert a refund claim against any of the entities that sold to me -- whether the seller has made a claim against me (making my refund claim a counterclaim) or has not made a claim against me (making my refund claim a cross-claim). but given my opposition to any refunds in this case, i would prefer to refrain from asserting my own refund claims (whether counterclaims or cross-claims), while reserving my right to do so in the future should the need arise. perhaps we should define a ripple claim simply as any r"}, {"role": "assistant", "content": "Regulatory, Master Agreements & Credit Guidelines"}]}
