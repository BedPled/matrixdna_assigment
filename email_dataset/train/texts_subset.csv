(sheri, please contact michelle cash and pat mackin to get available dates and then set-up a conference call including the above people as well as mikie rath and dolores lenfest. we probably need to do this as soon as possible in the new year. can you also include jane pleli, joann hill and sherry lessner, there may be issues with us changing current environment prior to 7/1/2000 that we need to consider.) thanks cb cc: cynthia michelle david mary david okay, so what is our next step? who can get the company set up? thanks, jane michael b 12/16/99 03:40 pm cc: cynthia michelle david mary david for the employees to be provided with domestic benefits, they could just be placed on the standard domestic payroll, whereas the employees not to have domestic benefits could be on the new company. as cynthia states below, the new company (as a whole) would not be adopting benefit plans. logistically, there would just need to be different procedures for setting up the new hires on the correct company. also, the administration of the cross charges will be much easier once sap payroll comes online 7/1. currently, there is some manual intervention when charging from one company (like expat services) to the appropriate accounting company. mike cc: david cynthia mary david michael b good point, we would want to pick and choose as some may not want to remain on home country payroll or a home country payroll may not exist. michelle, can you comment from a legal perspective? thanks, jane cynthia 12/16/99 11:16 am cc: david cynthia mary david the not making them eligible for domestic benefits is easy. the new payroll company will simply not adopt the plans. i am assuming that the number of employees (nor associated demographics) in this company will not create a discrimination problem. one question though, will we treat all foreign nationals the same or will you want to pick and choose who receive domestic benefits and who does not. if the answer is yes to this we will probably need to run some legal traps. let me know if we can help. cb cc: david cynthia mary david as enron expands globally, we are faced with a growing issue of more and more foreign nationals entering the us on varied lengths of assignment. for some, it is necessary that they remain on their home country payroll to maintain retirement benefits, as our domestic benefits structure (401(k), cash balance, etc.) does not provide them with equivalent benefits based on the fact they will return to their home country to retire. if they remain on their home country payroll system, we are struggling with a convenient method to have them pay us taxes (both income and possibly social security) as well as receive us $. currently, david oxley is on such an arrangement. he is paid by the uk a portion of his pay to maintain uk benefits. the remainder of his salary is paid on us payroll. this allows him to pay in fit withholding. no fica/medicare is necessary due to the totalization agreement with the uk. unfortunately, this created some extra work on the domestic benefits group as they had to code the hr system not to provide him with flex dollars, health/welfare and retirement benefits. we indicated in his employment agreement that he was not eligible for these benefits. i am looking for an easier and more efficient way to do this. would it be possible to create a payroll company here in the us for arriving foreign nationals that remain on their home country payroll that would allow them a mechanism receive a portion of their pay in us $ into a us account pay in fit and possibly fica/medicare not make them eligible for domestic benefits i would appreciate you and the others i have copied looking into this. thanks, jane"

"cc: bcc: thanks, harry. i want to re-enforce the switching issue, since ees is likely to be very focused on moving customers back to the utility on tuesday. switching would certainly reduce ees' going-forward exposure to 1) growing ""credit receivables"" that the utilities refuse to pay and 2) the risk that the commission will end the rate freeze altogether---and the px credit with it--as part of the hearing process that commences with the pre-hearing conference on wednesday. reducing that exposure is clealry important to ees. but the utilities' ability to resist taking back customers is likely to be significant, particularly since 90% of the volumes that we serve are on enron meters. imagine the road blocks that the utility can/will construct over the ""complex process"" of changing-out the meters. in addition, when ca border gas prices spiked several weeks ago, many large gas customers tried to switch from noncore to core service on socalgas' system. socalgas submitted an emergency motion at the commission to prevent the switching and the commission granted it in the wink of an eye. it will be important for ees to drill down fairly deeply in its analysis of all the ways that the utility can frustrate any switching. otherwise, we may find ourselves confronting a lot of negative pr without having reduced any of ees' exposure. customers who have been unwillingly switched back to the utility have become very vocal about their displeasure and have turned negative on esps as a result. best, jeff harry kingerski 01/07/2001 11:21 am palmer/enron communications cc: jeff james d these 3 issues will be discussed at your tuesday afternoon meeting with ees: what to do about forcing the utilities to pay delinquent px credits through december, the total arrearage is about $220m total, mostly from pg&e. neither utility is paying. vicki sharpe is lining up bankruptcy counsel. should the new 1 cent surcharge be passed on to our customers vicki has not said yet whether our contracts allow passthrough, although she has hinted it would require a very aggressive interpretation of the contract. should we try to return our customers to utility bundled service aside from the modifications to our customer contracts that have to take place, an even stickier issue is to get the utilities to take them back. even if the utilities are required to do so, forms have to be processed and meters have to be changed out. (we have our own meters on our accounts.) this could not happen quickly. of course, this action mitigates against the risk of the rate freeze ending but does nothing for the credit problem, other than to keep the exposure from getting larger. on wednesday, there will be a pre-hearing conference at the cpuc on the next phase of the end-the-rate-freeze case. jeff and i have talked about this and think we can decide what our involvement will be (witnesses, positions, etc.) after a schedule is set. for now, the strategy is to make sure the cpuc on wednesday adopts a schedule that deals with all the issues they must deal with about the rate freeze. (rick, i will be in san francisco through wednesday meeting with mike day and working with roger yang to identify all those issues.)"

(nyse: ene) stock sustained further he= avy losses on october 19 as investor confidence in the former wall street f= avorite remained at a low ebb after it reported its first quarterly loss in= over four years. the energy giant's stock was off $3.32 or 11.45 percent a= t $25.68 per share at mid-day trade on oct. 19, making a cumulative loss of= 28 percent for a week in which it reported a third-quarter loss of $638 mi= llion. as of early morning trading on oct. 22, enron shares were priced at = $21.99, a reflection of new developments (including a new securities and ex= change inquiry) that have caused uncertainty about the company among invest= ors.=20 analysis: enron's first financial report since the departure of former ceo = jeffrey skilling in august has not done much to once again instill investor= confidence in the company, which has experienced one of its most turbulent= years in recent memory. while skilling cited personal reasons for his depa= rture, many analysts suspected that a significant drop in enron's share pri= ce and financial losses in its diversified businesses also played a role. a= t the time of skilling's departure, enron's stock had tumbled to a 52-week = low. however, based on the new 3q report, it now appears that enron's downw= ard turn may be continuing despite the return of kenneth lay to the company= 's top spot. in essence, enron's financial problems have been caused by bus= inesses that the company has established as a way to diversify from its cor= e focus on wholesale power sales. it appears that enron is learning a costl= y lesson-namely that investors are not responding favorably to the company'= s innovation, especially if bottom line performance is in any way compromis= ed. the road ahead may remain uncertain for enron, as a good number of unre= solved issues and a new securities and exchange commission (sec) inquiry in= to financial dealings of its chief financial officer continue to overshadow= the company.=20 let's first establish the financial losses that enron has reported in the t= hird quarter. as noted, as a whole the company reported $638 million in los= ses, after taking $1.01 billion in charges associated with several of its n= on-core businesses. when we break down the losses, it becomes clear that en= ron is struggling with its operations in three businesses: water, broadband= and the retail power market. specifically, enron reported $287 million in = charges from azurix, its water and wastewater business; $180 million in cha= rges related to the downsizing of its broadband operations (including sever= ance costs and losses on inventory sales and customer contracts); and $544 = million in what the company is calling ""investment losses."" evidently, abou= t half of the $544-million figure is related to enron's investment in newpo= wer company, the retail electricity and natural-gas provider that enron lau= nched about two years ago with partners america online and ibm. enron owns = 45 percent of newpower. in addition, enron's debt to total capitalization r= atio reportedly will increase to about 50 percent, although lay says that p= ending asset sales may reduce that amount to 40 percent by the end of 2002.= however, it is important to note that enron's 3q recurring net income (bef= ore the write-offs) did increase 35 percent to $393 million, or 43 cents a = diluted share, and revenue in the quarter rose to $47.6 billion from $30 bi= llion in 3q 2000.=20 the losses associated with newpower are particularly interesting. as one of= the leading investors in the company, enron drove newpower's aggressive bu= siness focus on retail residential power sales, despite ongoing concerns ab= out the development of retail competition across the united states. newpowe= r went public last year at an opening price of $21, and in the early days o= f its initial public offering was trading above that price. however, the co= mpany's stock has experienced a devastating drop in value, and is currently= priced at $1.25. newpower is not scheduled to release its own 3q financial= statement until early november, but it is expected that the company will c= ontinue to incur significant losses for the foreseeable future. specificall= y, newpower recently reiterated its earlier expectations of a 3q loss of $6= 5 million to $70 million, or $1.12 to $1.20 a share. third-quarter revenue = reportedly will be slightly lower than the $60 million to $65 million that = the company had forecast in august.=20 in analyzing newpower's 2q financial losses (see issuealert from 8/8/01 at = www.scientech.com/rci < i argu= ed that the company is really struggling from a mix of positive and negativ= e factors in its efforts to become the leading retail energy provider in re= sidential and small business markets in the united states. on the positive = side, newpower has recently secured a large number of new customer accounts= , most significantly from its purchase of customers and related assets from= aes corp. and dte energy. these purchases prompted an impressive growth sp= urt for newpower, and the company reportedly now has a customer base in 22 = markets in 10 states. however, the bad news for newpower is that its losses= continue to widen, apparently resulting from a combination of weather fact= ors and financial hits absorbed in several of the states in which the compa= ny operates. this dichotomy does not appear to be getting any better, and t= he company's stock has continued to drop as a result.=20 in an effort to alleviate some of its financial woes, newpower recently rev= ised an existing master netting agreement with enron corp. and several of i= ts subsidiaries. the revised agreement essentially lowers the amount of cas= h collateral that newpower is required to post to the enron subsidiaries th= rough jan. 4, 2002. with the lowered financial obligations that it must mak= e to enron, newpower believes that it will have sufficient financial resour= ces to conduct its business in the near term until it secures ongoing asset= -based financing.=20 however, from enron's perspective, the losses associated with newpower (and= , by the same token, the losses in water and broadband) have contributed to= a steady drop in its own stock price. the message is clear: the businesses= that enron plunged into as a way to diversify have tainted the company as = a whole. further, what some analysts perceived as brash hubris on enron's p= art has not translated into measurable profits, and consequently wall stree= t has reacted by sending enron's stock to a level that is about half of whe= re it was a year ago. the individual sectors that enron has pursued are all= unique, but they share the common denominator of taking enron away from wh= at was a successful core business. further, they are similar in that enron = aggressively sunk large sums of capital into new business lines for which i= t arguably had unrealistic expectations for growth. the problem with enron'= s bandwidth unit is that the company has faced an unanticipated excess of f= iber-optic lines, which has prevented the demand for the division's service= s from materializing as anticipated. the problem with azurix, which has bee= n losing money since its formation in 1998, is that privatization of the wa= ter sector has not materialized as quickly as enron and other companies ant= icipated. in addition to these problem areas, enron also faces challenges r= elated to its investments in india (where it is locked into a legal battle = with the state government) and california (from which enron has yet to rece= ive full payment for previous power sales).=20 in addition to the losses outlined in the 3q report, there are new issues t= hat are brewing at the start of this week. first, the sec has requested tha= t enron provide information regarding ""certain related party transactions.""= not much additional information is presently available about this inquiry.= however, it is probably connected to earlier reports about concerns relate= d to the dealings of enron's chief financial officer andrew fastow, who up = until very recently had run a limited partnership that bought assets from e= nron. ken lay has said that enron will cooperate fully with the sec's reque= st. in a separate development, several mutual funds (including aim constell= ation that once held large positions in enron) have either liquidated or re= duced their holdings in the company, which has further weakened enron's sto= ck value. portfolio managers of the mutual funds have cited concerns about = enron's ability to balance its new businesses with its core strength as an = energy trader.=20 the present challenge for enron is to convince investors that the company r= emains on solid ground despite the losses. thus, lay has been quick to reit= erate that earnings from the company's energy and gas-pipeline business are= still strong. further, lay says that the charges reported in the third qua= rter should be seen as a way to ""clear away issues that have clouded the pe= rformance and earnings potential of our core energy businesses."" neverthele= ss, the fact remains that enron has invested huge amounts of money toward i= ts diversification effort, and in addition to water and broadband the compa= ny has invested into the steel and pulp and paper sectors as well. thus, se= veral questions remain at this juncture. are the losses reported in the thi= rd quarter only a temporary setback for enron that will clear the way for t= he company to return to a primary focus on its core business of energy trad= ing? or, will the losses continue into the fourth quarter and 2002? moving = forward, will enron once again reshape its business model and eliminate the= various businesses to which investors have reacted less than favorably? on= ly time will tell as the industry continues to watch the

""peace energy is a better system for serving our unregulated electric and gas customers since we now have the capability to bill for multiple fuels, services and locations on a single statement,"" said todd raba, vice preside= nt of market and sales at midamerican energy. analysis: this could materialize into a very strategic alliance for both companies. on the national or international stage, des moines, iowa-based midamerican may not be considered a major player. yet, within the midwest, it is a recognizable brand name and sizeable presence. the company and its subsidiaries manage and own interests in more than 10,000 mw of=20 diversified power generation facilities around the world, providing both regulated and unregulated electric and natural-gas services to more than 1.3 million customers in six states and the united kingdom (through its northern electr= ic & gas subsidiary). in august, midamerican made its move into ohio, the fourth largest u.s. market in terms of customers (behind california, texas and florida), indicating that the utility intends to aggressively grow in the retail sector and gain a corner on the increasingly competitive midwest market. just last monday, midamerican became the first energy compa= ny to become registered as a certified retail electric supplier (cres) in the cincinnati gas & electric co. territory in southwest ohio. an essential element to the utility's growth is a comprehensive billing software system, which is where the value of peace software comes in.=20 according to midamerican, it aims to be able to provide customers with online energy usage and billing data on a 24/7 basis. also important to midamerican as it enters different states is the elimination of ""several automated and manual processes required by our current system."" this can result in a real cost savings for an energy company as it can eliminate back office functions such as taking calls for final reads and address changes, all of which can be handled directly by the customer through online software. in this particular case, peace's energy software will provide to midamerica= n customers several self-serve features, including customer enrollment, summa= ry billing, more flexible due dates and electronic payment options. the energy system was developed for retail energy companies and is capable of handling many functions required by retailers, from enrollment and registration to billing to settlement and load forecasting. the last two features are particularly noteworthy as, up to this point, they have been rarely found in billing software. many systems in the united states today are building this competency or are ""bolting on"" the technology; peace already offers it in a ""one-stop-shop"" tool. peace software is a growing company and had secured some key utility contra= cts prior to this one with midamerican, including enron, bc gas, dominion retai= l, nordic electric, exelon energy, and pepco services. the company is based in atlanta and maintains a large presence in its country of origin, new zealand, the first country to deregulate its electric utilities. i spoke with brian peace, ceo of peace software, last june and he gave an overview of how the energy system functions. first, the energy system is centered around the unix operating system and thus can be moved and upgraded from one hardware platform to another. since its start in 1988, peace software has designed the energy system around a multiple-product architecture that has enabled the company to encapsulate water, gas and electricity into one product suite. currently, the system handles not only those three commodities, but also can consolidate billing information relat= ed to telecommunications, home security, home mortgaging and other value-added commodities and services. the end result is that an energy service provider can group all of its services into one bill stating one cost, which is a market edge against competitors that only provide multiple billing. at the time of our discussion, peace said, ""esps can no longer just rely on a commodity margin anymore. they've got to be able to buy it at the right price, combine it with the right services and then deliver it in a very convenient way to the customers. this is the path to being competiti= ve and profitable."" over the last decade, peace software gained a real lock on the new zealand market, and began selling its technology in the united states in 1997. that same year the company secured a contract with enron, which at the time owned portland general and was attempting to penetrate the california retail market. of course, enron ultimately extinguished its retail marketin= g efforts in california, but still uses the peace energy software as it=20 continues to penetrate other markets. peace software's alliance with insite=01*a new york-based application service provider=01*has led to providing the softwar= e for the billing needs of exelon. brian peace has said that for all of these utilities the key value of the software is the added convenience that they can market to new customers. of course, although peace software's contract with midamerican certainly elevates the company and gives it additional stature in the midwest market, the billing software business presents stiff competition. perhaps the two greatest competitors for peace software are sct and excelergy. sct offers the sct banner product, which was originally created to bill multiple=20 commodity customers in the utility environment and has done quite well. enlogix uses the sct banner system to support multi-services across its client base including gas, financing, ancillary products, electricity, water, and solid waste. excelergy was incubated in the deregulating states of the northeast while peace was incubated in the deregulating markets of new zealand and australia. peace software and excelergy also have recently made their own inroads into the gas markets. peace has entered the canadian gas market by implementing its energy software product at bc gas, headquartered in vancouver, which serves about 750,000 customers. excelergy has implemented its billing product at boston gas, which serves about 535,000 customers. as competitive esps attempt to secure new customers in deregulating markets= , one of the key advantages will be a convenient and multi-faceted billing and customer care system. facing a cloud of rather similar pricing offers, customers may be more enticed to select an esp that offers the value-added service offerings found in software developed by peace and its competitors. midamerican has branded itself with the tag line ""obsessively, relentlessly at your service."" the company is obviously making customer service a=20 centerpiece of its competitive strategy by adopting the peace energy software suite to support its entry into new markets.

(part 1 of 2) salomon smith barney industry note power & natural gas squeezing blood from a stone: seeking clarity in the calif. crisis january 4, 2001 summary * california utilities (pcg, eix) threaten bankruptcy in raymond niles face of cash squeeze and decision by california public utilities commission to grant a 7%-15% rate increase versus the 20%-30% hoped for by the utilities. two key points: * (1) based on the companies' statements, we think there is material risk that the california utilities will declare bankruptcy, although this still remains the least likely outcome, in our view. we maintain our 3h (neutral, high risk) rating on pcg at the present time. * (2) we recommend investors hold the course on energy merchants and competitive generators. favorable long-term fundamentals remain in place. ultimately, we think a market-oriented solution will favor these companies, but anticipate near-term uncertainty as the california situation plays itself out. companies with most to least california exposure are: cpn, soe, dyn, nrg, duk, rei, aes, ene. two messages to investors (1) worry about the california electric utilities: pcg and eix. material bankruptcy risk exists for these companies. although we do not think it is the most likely outcome, we think the risk of a bankruptcy has been heightened by the small rate increase proposed by the california public utilities commission. even if bankruptcy does not occur, we think that the california utilities will continue to be challenged by weak balance sheets and ongoing cash flow concerns if adequate rate increases are not enacted. (2) hold the course on the energy merchants and competitive generators. the long-term fundamentals for these companies remains firm, in our view. for the generators, we forecast 20%-25% higher power prices, nationwide, in 2001 vs. 2000. at the same time, we see the ""spark spread"", or the spread between power (revenues) and gas (costs) widening by several percentage points during the same time period. both of these factors are positive for earnings. for the marketers, the opportunity to hedge and manage energy price risk has only been heightened by the turmoil in california. we also remain bullish on these companies. exposures of generators to california power markets (megawatts) company rating/px total california % of total aes# 1-h $52 29,798 4,100 13.8% cpn# 1-h $42 5,912 1,355 22.9% dyn# 1-h $51 8,804 1,400 15.9% nrg# 1-h $28 13,500 1,586 11.7% soe# 1-h $28 14,622 3,185 21.8% ene# 1-h $80 3,000 60 2.0% duk*# 2-m $83 9,285 3,615 38.9%* rei*$# 3-m $43 12,869 3,767 29.3%* *duk and rei also have extensive regulated utility operations, so there corporate financial exposure to california is far less than the percentages indicated what lies ahead? points to consider: (1) someone must pay for the cost of power in california. currently, natural gas prices are around $20 per mcf or million btu's, which equates to electricity prices north of $200 per megawatt-hour. this reflects the cost of burning gas to create electricity, and does not consider other costs, such as pollution emissions, operating and maintenance costs, and the capital costs of plant investment. (2) the long-term problem in california (and elsewhere in the country) will not be solved without the construction of new power plants. all the bellyaching in the world about high wholesale power prices will not solve the problem, which is: california does not have enough power plants. the wholesale price of electricity reflects supply and demand. there are not enough electrons in the state's power grid. more electrons will come either from new plants (power generation) or marketing (shipping more electricity into the state). we also think concomitant infrastructure must be enhanced, such as natural gas pipeline and electric transmission capacity. (3) the generators and marketers are solving the problem. companies such as dynegy, enron, el paso energy, duke energy, calpine, southern energy, aes, nrg energy and others are either building the plants and/or marketing the power and natural gas that will, in the long run, ""solve"" california's power crisis. in fact, the high prices they are receiving for power and gas are both the incentives and the reward for them to do so. in our view, if sufficient new generating capacity is built in california, the wholesale price of power will fall. we think if policies were enacted today to facilitate the construction of new plants, by 2002 power prices could be materially lower than they are today. (4) re-regulation would only lengthen and deepen the power crisis in california. capping wholesale power prices, imposing windfall profits taxes or other ""punitive"" measures will not cause a single new power plant to be built or a single new electron to be sold in the state. such measures would dis- incentivize new plant construction and actually lengthen the crisis. we already think that the threat of re-regulation has had the perverse effect of raising wholesale power prices by dis-incentivizing sales into the state. our investment conclusions first, the long-term outlook for competitive energy suppliers is favorable. they are supplying a commodity in short supply. as long as the supply-demand balance, and price volatility remain, we expect strong earnings visibility from this core group of companies. we especially recommend accumulating positions in these companies ahead of the summer peak electricity earnings season. second, attempts to re-regulate or ""punish"" energy wholesalers could create near-term volatility in the stocks; we recommend buying on such weakness. given our long-term view, we do not think that attempts to re-regulate will be successful. in fact, by doing so, policymakers would merely lengthen and deepen the crisis that already exists. also, recognition that the wholesale market is working well in other regions, such as texas, would only stimulate a debate that would lead to ultimate removal of any controls, in our view. price 1/3/01 2002 2002 ltg 2002 company sym rating target price est p/e est peg m energy merchants enron corp.# ene 1h $100 79.88 1.98 40.3 20% 2.0 duke energy # duk 2m $95 82.75 5.10 16.2 10% 1.6 el paso energy# epg 1h $80 70.25 3.70 19.0 15% 1.3 dynegy inc.# dyn 1h $70 51.31 2.25 22.8 20% 1.1 power producers southern energy# soe 1h $37 27.94 1.35 20.7 25% 0.8 calpine corp.# cpn 1h $60 41.75 1.58 26.4 35% 0.8 aes corp.# aes 1h $85 51.75 2.50 20.7 30% 0.7 nrg energy# nr 1h $40 27.56 1.70 16.2 25% 0.6 # within the past three years, salomon smith barney, including its parent, subsidiaries and/or affiliates, has acted as manager or co-manager of a public offering of this company. what's ahead? near-term events near-term, we await several events. each of these has the potential for creating trading opportunities in the stocks. (1) decision by s&p and moody's on whether to downgrade the debt of pcg and eix. they have threatened to lower the ratings on both companies to ""junk"" status (i.e., below investment grade) if the cpuc does not grant a sufficient rate increase. we think that the 7%-15% rate increase proposed by the cpuc is probably not sufficient to please the rating agencies, and that a debt downgrade is likely. we think a debt downgrade is largely priced into the stocks, but the action still could create volatility. (2) an emergency legislative hearing is underway. this hearing is deciding, among other measures, whether to impose a ""windfall profits tax"" or other punitive measures on the wholesale energy suppliers. given what we said above, we think such a move could hurt the energy suppliers, but only on a near-term basis. we would recommend buying on such weakness. an action that would be positive, in our view, would be any move by the legislature to address the root cause of california's problem: the restrictive policies that make it difficult to build plants in the state (e.g.: pollution rules, siting permits, etc). (3) decisions by the utilities on whether to declare bankruptcy. the utilities suffer from a negative cash flow, and have incurred over $8 billion in incremental costs to pay for power. their cash gross margin is negative because they receive a low (regulated) price for retail power and pay a high (unregulated) price for wholesale power. the utilities' lenders are watching carefully to see if any rate increase proposed by the cpuc is sufficient to address this imbalance before they will lend more money on a short-term basis. if the utilities cannot get short-term funding, we think insolvency is a likely eventuality, in our view. we still think bankruptcy is the least likely outcome, and for that reason, a bankruptcy announcement would have a negative effect on the stock prices of the utilities as well as the wholesale energy suppliers. (4) final decision by the cpuc on their proposed rate increase. a final decision on the 7%-15% proposed increase will be made today. if the cpuc decides to go with a higher or more favorable rate increase, this would be positive for the utilities and marketers.. (5) credit risk to suppliers - worst case analysis. the generators and marketers who sell power to the california utilities have significant credit risks associated with those exposures. the figure below attempts to quantify those risks, which could result in a one-time earnings hit. the figures we have calculated are a worst-case analysis, in our view, and any actual exposure are likely to be much less. first, these risks will only become a reality in the case of the utilities' bankruptcy. second, even given this worst-case bankruptcy scenario, the generators and marketers will likely be treated favorably in the bankruptcy case, given their status as trade creditors (30-45 day receivables). third, based on our conversations with these companies, they have already taken steps to mitigate these exposures by tightening credit limits, requiring payments in cash, etc. 12/00 mwhs produced @ exposure @ potential eps ca mw 40% factor $200 price exposure raymond niles first call corporation, a thomson financial company. all rights reserved. note id: 320970 ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ to update your order or to receive research on other companies, please call your account manager at . ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ thomson financial investor relations tel: 75 wall street, 18th floor fax: new york, ny 10005 email: first call is a registered trademark of the first call corporation"

"jeff, we have been working to try and get the crude products available in yen, but have not had much luck after darren left. you can see the general summary of the situation below. we'd like to get the product up and believe that with some basic publicity it could be quite successful. any ideas on how to overcome these points? joe -----original message----- sent: friday, october 12, 2001 12:08 pm -----original message----- sent: friday, september 21, 2001 5:42 pm cc: bekeng, jan-erland joe after spending some time with houston and london people over the past 2 weeks, the conclusion is that george cannot be up and running within the next 2-3 months. obtaining live fx quotes is the major issue. options that we considered were: (a) connect up to a bank's fx online system shane dallman (uk) identified potential issues with this, the main one being technical issues associated with the eol application. after consulting with eol people, it appears the fx manager application is not suitable for linking to an external party at the moment. they are working on these issues as part of a larger development project but i cannot get a clear timetable out of them (b) get thomas cheng to run the fx manager issues include: * thomas doesn't feel comfortable having to watch the fx market on a real time basis and update prices accordingly, given most of his time is spent on metals * in that case, fx group would like automatic updates of the fx price from the market so he would not have to watch it all the time (we then get back to it issues which shane is checking out) (c) get a fx trader in japan the fx group is currently considering their staffing requirements but pushkar shahi (director, fx houston) said that there are no immediate plans to get someone out here. i will keep monitoring the fx situation. perhaps if you have time next week, you could speak to gary hickerson to get his thoughts. regards rousseau"

"congrats ray. ... now, get ferc to do something amazing. ---------------------- forwarded by steven j kean/na/enron on 05/16/2001 02:12 am --------------------------- enron capital & trade resources corp. cc: harry james d robert steven j linda rebecca mcdonald/enron_development, peter e steve outstanding outcome- ray, this was an incredible result given the challenging context, to say the least....you should feel quite proud of this achievment- thanks! linda robertson 05/14/2001 01:06 pm cc: harry james d richard robert steven j excellent, and congratulations. ray alvarez 05/14/2001 12:34 pm james d cc: harry robert the rate case that the governmental affairs group filed in january, on behalf of transredes, has come to a very successful conclusion and the new rates will go into effect towards the end of this month. the rates are not much lower than what we filed for, and represent a very significant increase over the previous rates. the tariff methodology and revised regulations, put into effect by the supreme decree, were followed to the letter by the regulator despite political pressure to arbitrarily keep rates down. the deliverables here were to (1) obtain a tariff methodology via supreme decree that would make the company finance-able / rescue it from dire financial straits and (2) file a rate case and prosecute it to obtain hard rates in accordance with the tariff methodology. this second deliverable has now been completed. transredes has had a bond issue pending since last year due to the uncertainty about rates; it is my understanding that the financial market loved the ruling and that transredes sold $40 million worth of bonds in about 5 minutes! this ruling should also significantly increase transredes's market value, relative to enron's efforts to sell its interest in the company. ---------------------- forwarded by ray alvarez/na/enron on 05/14/2001 11:38 am --------------------------- doug farmer 05/11/2001 06:09 pm cc: jan van den john cyro pedro fernando gentlemen, i am delighted to report that sirese approved substantial increases in tr's tariffs consistent with the law and regulation. the details are :- existing tariff sirese approved % increase tr/clhb proposed tr/clhb % increase gas export (including surcharges) $0.18 $0.2205 22.5% $0.26 (excluding rg) 44.4% liquids domestic $1.05 $2.46 134.3% $3.25 209.5% liquids export $1.55 $2.31 49% $3.35 116.1% clhb's tariffs were also approved as follows $1.19 $2.20 84.9% $3.528 196.5% as you can see we did substantially better than clhb (comparable with our liquids domestic) !! we will get a detailed report on the assumptions used by sirese to reach their conclusions on monday, but our inteligence suggests the following :- 1. export gas volumes increased to 100% tr capacity, and 100% gsa + cuiaba 2 assumed for sda and temin purposes 2. rg compresion project deleted 3. interest rate reduced to 10 or 10.5 % i.e. the rate in our bond issue 4. liquids expansion in the south reduced 5. some continuity of service capex reduced 6. unknown opex reduction and maybe a change to the opex allocation between concesions 7. occ in service date slipped from 2003 to 2004. 8. debt/equity assumption changed from 60/40 to 70/30 our strategy to respond to each of these points is as follows :- 1. volumes. covered by 8% rule, we can blete but can expect little back here. clearly we will appeal if volumes exceed installed capacity in the short term i.e. 2002/2003. 2. rg compression - not worth fighting for since we don't even have the support of bg 3. interest rate - we'll get this back when we do a tariff revision and actual rates are used. when we get the detail we will appeal if jan feels we have concrete grounds i.e. commision costs etc. are omited. 4. liquids expansion in the south. here we intend to do a detailed analysis of exactly what has been deleted and as a result what liquids/gas production will be shut in. if possible all assumptions to be agreed with the affected producers (pb, bg, vintage and chaco). we will then write to those producers(copy sirese , vmeh etc.) stating that on their recommendation the project scope was reduced by sirese. we will give them an estimate of the lost liquids/gas production (in both volume and cash terms) resultant from this decision. we will tell them that since they proposed these reductions we have no intention of appealing them but invite them to appeal. 5. continuity of service capex. we need to see the detail here. we will take the moral high ground and be absolutely clear that we are not prepared to compromise our safety and environmental standards. we need to see exactly what has been removed, but my thought is that if that means we are unable to provide some services (e.g. lpg transportation) or the continued operation of some liquids laterals, we should write to those producers affected suggesting that if they wish these services to be continued they need to appeal the decision. again since this is capex we will get it back in the end on tariff revisions as long as the expenditure is approved on an annual basis in the sirese budget process. 6. opex - need to see the detail on monday. 7. occ - will not appeal - we need to do a detailed study to develop an occ strategy. 8. debt/equity ratio. strictly speaking what has been done is in accordance with the law/regulation - the regulation says the maximum allowed equity is 40%. however, we have very strong grounds to appeal since : a) we are currently miles away from 60/40 let alone 70/30, b) we can only borrow for capex (as per bond issue and the policy of all/most banks/lending institutions) with the case presented in the rate case if we borrow to cover 100% of capex we can easily demonstrate that we are still miles away from 60/40. we intend to fight this one very hard using all the external/independant help we can get. as you are all aware our big exposure with the rate case was that the much needed substantial increase in liquids tariffs would not be approved and we would be subjected to some form of arbitary cut. this has not happened sirese has now approved and hence owns these substantial increases. having got the big hike our job is now to claw back as much as we can from the above strategy in the full knowledge that the results of these efforts will be much smaller and hence managable increases. attached is an analysis of the individual impacts on the tariff of the above points and the corporate model using the new tariff with our volume assumptions (i.e. the worst case). regards, doug"
"sally i will give some deep thought over the weekend in the meantime here are some current thoughts regarding brent's trip first i am hopeful that a letter will go out regarding brent before his trip and that it clearly states that brent will continue to report directly to you (that sends a powerful message locally and globally) is that going to occur? assuming the above takes place what is the messaage you (sally) want brent to convey on your behalf at each and every meeting he attends with his and your people. thirdly i would suggest that brent and scott not try to hit a homerun on this first trip. you as well as brent and scott do not need to win the respect of shankman so i strongly urge consistency, maturity and incredible listening skills in fully understanding the depth and exact nature of the problems arising so solutions arise from the strength of the data surrounding the core issues. i would prepare brent with any language you would want him to appropriately respond to possible questions from sheriff, dyson, jordan or anyone else for that matter who might want to probe into whether all of operations is going to roll up under you. until you have your meeting with frevert i would offer that any questions that may come brent's or scott's way simply be diplomatically deferred. have them make simple i statements ""all i know is that my role here is to....."" i can't speak to what might be happening with other product lines."" i will read closely your notes, please have mary solmonson give you a copy of freverts talk at the global systems gathering and see if there are a couple of connection points for you to gateway your vision for global consistency to align with his. 1) my (sally) vision for this looks like this.... 2) why it makes sense to do this now? what's at risk if we don't do this now? paint a relistic yet challenging picture in hopes that he asks, are you sally up to the challenge? 3) others support this as well (does he care, if so who else?) 4) i want to move forward effective .....do i have your support if you have some time on monday let patti know and i will give you a call. assuming that a letter goes out on brent will you put a letter out on ena risk, settlementges, logistics, other staff changes such as scribner, sheila, hall, etc. if you do not have the time to write it up let me know and i can support you with a draft for your modification, however i would want to talk specifics monday. i am very excited for you and the organization and remain hopeful that this is yet another growth experience preparing you for an even greater role regrds tom ------original message------ sent: august 11, 2000 7:15:12 pm gmt fyi: rick agreed with the attached note that i sent him. by voice mail, i suggested ted murphy as a substitute for rick buy for the meeting. we are set for next thursday, august 17 at 11:45 in rick causey's office over lunch. i am meeting with ted this afternoon to fill him in on the purpose of the meeting and to be certain that i have his support. rick causey suggested citing some of the items in my memo to him when we get with frevert. any words of wisdom or suggestions for the meeting?

the summary of doorstep findings can be finalized early next week. i have checked mark's travel schedule. he will be in the houston office next week, with thursday, august 17 as the best day to potentially schedule a meeting. i am not trying to rush this process, yet i know that by the end of august much will have been decided around coordinating between ena, egm and eel operations. i would like to be in a position to help guide those decisions, rather than arrive at the party late."

"employees with an ax to grind -----original message----- sent: thursday, june 28, 2001 8:27 am these guys filed a bunch of complaints against sempra too, back when sempra owned the plant.---sch duke's calif whistleblowers have history of grievances updated: wednesday, june 27, 2001 07:36 pm et by jason leopold of dow jones newswires los angeles (dow jones)--three former employees who last week told california lawmakers duke energy (duk </investments/quotes/?symbol=duk>, news </investments/news/?symbol=duk>, msgs </investments/discuss/?symbol=duk>) ramped down its south bay power plant when supplies were tight filed a total of 34 complaints while they were still working at the plant, including allegations of harassment and racial discrimination, the men told dow jones newswires. most of the grievances were filed between 1999 and 2001 against the plant's previous owner, sempra energy (sre </investments/quotes/?symbol=sre>, news </investments/news/?symbol=sre>, msgs </investments/discuss/?symbol=sre>) unit san diego gas & electric, for which the men continued to work while duke controlled the plant. but interviews with the three men also revealed a dissatisfaction with duke's profit-centered management style in the deregulated market. duke has called the employees' allegations about its operating procedures ""baseless."" duke has said the employees have an ""ax to grind,"" because they weren't hired by the company in april when escrow on the power plant closed and duke acquired some of sdg&e's workforce. the men are the first to come forward publicly and testify against their employers, who are locked in a high-stakes struggle with the state of california over allegations of price gouging. the state is pursuing billions of dollars in refunds from power producers and hopes to bring criminal charges against their executives. glenn johnson, 52, a mechanic at the south bay power plant, alone filed 30 complaints. on one occasion, johnson said he called the california division of occupational safety and health, because an unqualified employee was found scraping up asbestos. he also has a harassment complaint against sdg&e regarding an employee who now works for duke, but johnson said his lawyer told him not to discuss it. aside from the formal complaints, johnson said under the duke regime he was disciplined for taking too much sick time after being out for 10 months for cancer treatment. ""this is just the kind of abuse we had to endure ever since this became a business,"" he said. one of the other employees, jim olkjer, 56, a former assistant control room operator at the power plant, filed three complaints against sdg&e while duke operated the plant, because his evaluations consistently said he needed supervision. the grievances were either turned down or settled, he said. olkjer said he decided to testify against duke after he learned he wouldn't be hired by the energy company when it took over plant operations in april. ""i'm on a fixed income now,"" olkjer said in an interview. ""i can't afford my utility bills on a fixed income."" the third employee, ed edwards, 42, a certified power plant mechanic, said he filed one complaint against three sdg&e employees in 1999 for racial discrimination. one of the employees was hired by duke. that case is still pending. edwards, an african-american, said duke didn't hire qualified minority employees after it took over the plant and instead hired less-qualified white employees. edwards said the two minority supervisors that worked at the plant under sdg&e were replaced with white employees when duke took over. edwards, who stopped working at the plant in february, said he decided to testify against duke after receiving a phone call from johnson. ""i knew i wouldn't be hired,"" he said. edwards and johnson filed charges of harassment and racial discrimination against sdg&e with the u.s. equal employment opportunity commission. sdg&e spokesman art larson wouldn't comment on the allegations. duke spokesman tom williams said the company stands by its hiring practices and ""always hires the most qualified employees."" in 1999, duke settled a 1996 discrimination claim with the u.s. department of labor for $769,700, in which the department found some areas where white females and black males were paid less than white male and black female counterparts in similar positions. dissatisfaction with new priorities the former employees said they weren't motivated to blow the whistle on duke by the prospects of cashing in on a possible settlement with the state. johnson first alerted the media about duke's behavior before state attorney general bill lockyer mentioned financial rewards for whistleblowers. the employees each earned about $1,000 a week. all three employees said they believe duke mismanaged the south bay power plant by ramping the units up and down, tossing out spare parts, and operating machinery when it was broken. olkjer said he saw the plant's output reduced during the worst power emergencies ""at least 50 times."" when edwards questioned his supervisors about the behavior he said they told him, ""it's none of your business."" the employees said that duke was more concerned with making money than the happiness of its staff, and that the company tried to bust its union contract when it first took over the plant. ""i was paid to twist wrenches,"" johnson said. ""the last raise i got two years ago was 2.25%. that's an insult to my skill."" duke said it is bringing the former sdg&e employees under its contract with international brotherhood of electrical workers local 1245. the workers were previously represented by another local, and duke wanted a single contract. johnson said he decided to blow the whistle on duke because he was disgusted by the company's ""gluttony and greed."" he said he stole the control room logs in february after a colleague pointed out to him that duke was reducing output at the plant. johnson, edwards and olkjer said ""in the old days"" the power plant ran at full throttle and never ramped up or down. but as soon as deregulation became law in the state, things started to change. sdg&e would also vary the plant's output, but not as dramatically as duke did, they said. ""to the best of my recollection, we had years of being extremely reliable and being on line all the time,"" edwards said. ""once duke took the reins, that changed. we were no longer a family."" duke has said that it adjusted the plant's output to meet its contractual commitments and to respond to the directions of the california independent system operator, manager of the state's power grid. the iso frequently directed plants to ramp output up and down to meet changing requirements on the grid, and the employees who testified weren't in a position to know the whole picture, said bill hall, vice president of duke's western operations. duke spokesman tom williams said the company plans to release data showing the iso ordered the plant to ramp up and down jan. 16-18, the period cited from the control-room logs, to keep supply in balance. a copy of the iso control-room logs obtained by dow jones newswires shows that the iso did make such orders during a stage 3 emergency, because it didn't need duke's capacity, which it thought too expensive. -by jason leopold, dow jones newswires; ; <mail <embedded picture (metafile)>"

"cc: bcc: jeff: i have followed up with other doe politicals who advised they will meet this thursday with bob gee to finalize and approve his speech to naruc on monday, july 24th. it is looking positive that he may be positioned to make the announcement monday. however, doe will likely need to revisit some folks on the current blue ribbon reliability panel in order to replace some of the utility transmission-only focused members with others who focus on business practices plus add additional people to represent the internet like apx, altra, and houstonstreet.com. (these are steve kean's suggestions.) too, i have been cautioned about referring to the blue ribbon reliability panel as a model since their timeline was slow, but rather suggest the tva blue ribbon panel model since they were able to issue a report after only four meetings. i have asked for this issue to be brought to secretary richardson's attention and advised this will be done this week. i have also discussed this with john anderson of elcon who is supportive. jeff 07/18/2000 12:45 pm steven j richard james d cc: cynthia janine jeff cynthia and i met with bob gee regarding a potential role for doe in creating a national standards board. bob appeared comfortable with establishing a ""blue ribbon"" panel, similar to the reliability panel, to address this issue. in fact, bob suggested that the reliability panel, which includes a balance of key stakeholders, could be re-tasked with this issue. we recommended that the focus of any panel should be on the structure (governance, segments, executive committees) and scope of the organization (retail, wholesale, gas, electric). bob plans to follow-up with us next week. jeff"

"for epsa comments, due march 30th cc: bcc: fyi ----- forwarded by bernadette hawkins/corp/enron on 03/20/2001 03:55 pm ----- ""jackie gallagher"" 03/20/2001 02:30 pm cc: for epsa comments, due march 30th memorandum power marketers working group bob reilley, power marketers working group chair julie simon, vice president of policy mark bennett, senior manager of policy erin perrigo, manager of policy re: commission actions to increase supply and decrease consumption in the western united states--key points for epsa comments due march 30th as we previously reported, on march 14, 2001, ferc announced certain actions to address the energy problems in california and other areas of the west in an order removing obstacles to increased electric generation and natural gas supply in the western united states and requesting comments on further actions to increase energy supply and decrease energy consumption. the following is an overview of the steps the commission proposes to ""immediately help increase supply from existing power sources and to provide regulatory incentives to build new electric and natural gas infrastructure."" the commission also invited comments on certain proposals. this memo includes a list of key points we intend to make in comments that are due by march 30th. overview of order the order reflects a thorough review of ""all of [ferc's] rate and facility certification authorities in the areas of electric energy, natural gas, hydroelectric and oil to determine how it can increase electric energy supply""; however, the commission noted that its authority is ""somewhat limited."" while the commission believes state regulators must assume the lead role due to their authority over siting of generation and transmission, as well as demand reduction measures, the commission noted that the impact of california's energy shortage on the western interconnection ""underscores the regional, interstate nature of the energy marketplace."" accordingly, it encouraged the formation of a single regional transmission organization for western markets. epsa appreciates the commission's effort to exercise the full extent of its authority to help ease the west's energy problems. taken together, the commission's proposed actions represent positive steps toward rational solutions to the difficult circumstances in the west. most importantly, the order highlights the importance of promoting infrastructure investment, including increased generation, transmission and natural gas pipeline facilities. the commission's immediate actions, which will expire on december 31, 2001, include: -requiring the california iso and transmission owners within the wscc to provide ferc with a list of short-term grid enhancements. -extending and broadening waivers of operating and efficiency standards and fuel use requirements for qualifying facilities (qf). -providing wholesale power sales from generation used primarily for backup and self-generation for businesses with prior notice waivers and market-based rate authorization. -allowing wholesale and retail load reduction to be resold at wholesale market-based rates. the commission seeks comment on several other proposals, including: -rolling in new supply interconnection and upgrade costs. -increasing the rate of return on equity for projects that significantly increase transmission on constrained and new routes in the near term. -10-year depreciation for short-term transmission projects, and 15-year depreciation for upgrades involving new rights of way that can be in service by november 1, 2002. -use of the interconnection authority set forth in fpa o210(d) to help alleviate obstacles to electric supply reaching load. epsa's comments in its conclusion, the commission stated that comments should be ""concise and focused."" accordingly, we suggest that epsa's comments focus on the following areas: ? applaud the commission's effort to increase supplies from qfs, but encourage it to provide relief from existing contracts by allowing qfs to sell to creditworthy parties. ? we understand that there are ongoing differences of opinion regarding the relative merits of an incremental versus a ""rolled in"" approach to interconnection and upgrade costs. therefore, while we may lack a consensus on the question as a final policy position, we believe that the extreme circumstances surrounding the order, and the urgent need to move power quickly into the western system, make it wise to endorse ferc's instant recommendation. ? the commission's proposed actions to create and enhance incentives relating to expanding and improving the transmission infrastructure through higher roes and accelerated depreciation schedules are positive steps. the commission normally conditions such premiums on meaningful participation in regional transmission organizations. however, given the current situation and the immediate impact of any projects that might be entitled to the higher roe, epsa could support this proposal. ? constraints on the gas infrastructure have a generally adverse impact on the energy supply system. therefore, the commission's proposed waivers of blanket certificates and rate incentives to expedite construction projects, are favorable developments. we will discuss the order and epsa's comments during tomorrow's regulatory affairs/power marketers' conference call. in addition, we have been asked to consider what type of short-term relief could be included in federal legislation. we will discuss this question as well. to access the call, dial 1- and ask for the julie simon/epsa call. in the meantime, if you have any questions, please contact either julie simon, or mark bennett, at )."

""i went to the texas camp two weeks ago and they offered me a scholarship,"" labron said monday night. ""i verbally committed to them when i met with the coaches with my dad. i'm waiting for my mom to come home from puerto rico so she can talk to them, too. to tell you the truth, i'm going there anyway. i'm going to be a longhorn."" * * * * i talked to chris hill, roy williams' mother, tonight and she said the shoulder injury roy suffered on the opening kickoff of the texas-california all-star game saturday night, involves stretched ligaments and she said the doctors say it will heal on it own. california won the game, 29-27, on a 53-yard fg on the final play. ""he's in a lot of pain,"" she said. ""it's very sore. we took him to a specialist and the examination showed stretched ligaments in the shoulder. the specialist said it should heal on its own in a few weeks."" she also said the doctor said he should be fully recovered by the time the freshmen report at texas in mid-august. williams, a great wide receiver prospect from odessa permian,is one of the top longhorn recruits. he is 6-3, weighs 208 pounds and he ran a 10.03 100 meters last track season. he also high jumped 7-0 and he set a state record in the broad jump at the state meet with a 25-6 leap. sloan thomas of klein, another of the outstanding wr recruits texas signed in february, caught five passes in the second half and was one of the key players who led the texas team's comeback from a 26-7 deficit. he caught one touchdown pass and set up two others with outstanding catches in heavy traffic. on the two great catches in traffic, he was behind the secondary, but had to come back because the balls were underthrown. he ran a 10.38 100 meters his junior year and, like williams, has a great combination of size and speed. he is 6-2 and weighs almost 200 pounds. de kalen thornton of dallas st. mark's, another ut signee, split time at end and tackle and was outstanding at both. he had two sacks and consistently put pressure on the california quarterbacks. c jason glynn and dt sonny davis, the other two ut signees who played in the game, also looked good when they got to play. glynn opened some good holes on the late scoring drive that put texas ahead, 27-26, with just 17 seconds left. davis appeared to be carrying a little excess weight, but he was able to push the cal blockers back into the backfield at times. this was the second straight year california has won the game in the final seconds. b. j. johnson, the nation's no. 1 wr recruit and another texas signee, sprained an ankle a week before the game and was not able to play. he said the ankle sprain is mild and won't hamper his ability to be in good shape for the start of workouts at ut in less than seven weeks. * * * * recruiting notes: dt tommie harris, lebron's teammate at killeen ellison, says texas and florida state are his top two teams right now, followed by a&m, miami and ucla. harris probably is the nation's top dt recruit, and he is a good friend of greg barnum, the center who quit the tennessee team several weeks ago and is considering transferring to texas to continue his football career. * * * * my next fax will be whenever events warrant. * * * * the true orange fax service includes at least 99 faxes a year and costs $99 ($79 by e-mail). the true orange newsletter includes 26 newsletters and is published weekly during football season and twice monthly during most of the other months. it costs $45. save by subscribing to both for $130 (or $110 if you take the faxes via e-mail or $99 if you take the faxes and newsletter via e-mail). send check to address at the top of page. i also update my 900 number ? 1- ? frequently with recruiting news. my e-mail address is:"

this disclosure should inform the reference entity of the introduction of= =20 the product, and describe the general nature of the product and the manner = in=20 which it will be traded (e.g., through enron online). ? in general, however, enron need not request that the reference entities= =20 consent to or acknowledge their inclusion in the list of the reference=20 entities, except as set forth below in paragraph 2.=20 2. consent =01* enron should, however, obtain the prior consent of certai= n=20 types of reference entities before including them in the list of reference= =20 entities. ? in particular, consent should be obtained from any reference entities wit= h=20 which enron has a significant trading relationship that includes advice or= =20 other services that could result in enron being considered a fiduciary of t= he=20 reference entity or that could otherwise give rise to common law duties tha= t=20 could be violated if the reference entity does not consent to the arrangeme= nt. ? enron need not seek consent from those large and sophisticated=20 counterparties to which enron merely provides prices and with which enron= =20 trades on an exclusively arms=01, length basis with no advisory or similar= =20 services being provided and with no fiduciary obligations. ? where consent is sought, enron should include a request that the referenc= e=20 entity acknowledge its receipt of the letter and its consent to being=20 included in the list of reference entities. if a reference entity fails or= =20 refuses to execute the letter, enron will need to make a determination, on = a=20 case-by-case basis, as to whether it is comfortable including that entity o= n=20 the list of reference entities. however, it should be recognized that, by= =20 requesting consent, enron may be limiting its ability to treat an entity as= a=20 reference entity in the absence of consent. 3. chinese wall =01* we understand that it will not be feasible to construc= t a=20 complete =01&chinese wall=018 between the operations related to the product= and=20 enron=01,s other trading activities. this is due primarily to the fact tha= t=20 activities related to the product will utilize the same credit function as= =20 enron=01,s other trading activities. however, enron should implement a mod= ified=20 chinese wall between the trading operations. this approach would enhance= =20 enron=01,s ability to defend successfully against any claims of impropriety= or=20 breach of duty by facilitating enron=01,s ability to demonstrate that=20 information had not been shared by other traders with those trading the=20 product. this could be accomplished through a number of procedures. ? first, enron should maintain the maximum possible degree of physical=20 separation between personnel responsible for pricing and trading the produc= t,=20 on the one hand, and enron=01,s other trading activities, on the other hand= . =20 even if personnel involved in the product are located on the same floor as= =20 other traders, it would be prudent to place them in a separate area of the= =20 floor set off by partitions or similar features. ? second, procedures should be developed to prohibit the flow of informatio= n=20 between product traders and other traders if such information is material t= o=20 the creditworthiness of trading counterparties and is not in the public=20 domain. in addition, all trading personnel should be instructed with respe= ct=20 to the procedures through training programs. ?

enron should also establish procedures to monitor its receipt of=20 information regarding reference entities on which products are listed. =20 pursuant to these procedures, enron should suspend the listing of quotation= s,=20 and therefore the issuance of new products, with respect to a reference=20 entity, if enron is in possession of material, non-public information=20 regarding such entity of a type, or in situations, that render suspension= =20 necessary or advisable. this would include situations in which enron is=20 considering an investment in or a joint venture with a reference entity. i= n=20 addition, the procedures should provide for reference entities to be exclud= ed=20 or deleted for reasons unrelated to enron=01,s possession of information as= =20 well; e.g., where enron has reached or exceeded its credit limits with=20 respect to such entities.=20 ? the procedures should state that enron may close out an open position for= a=20 product held by a counterparty, if the counterparty specifically requests= =20 enron to do so. the procedures should also address the pricing of the=20 closing transaction, however, and establish a mechanism for such pricing th= at=20 minimizes enron=01,s potential exposure to liability as a result of its=20 effecting a transaction while in possession of material, non-public=20 information.=20 ?

"cc: bcc: west traders et al. ferc's meeting, which will include the issue of price mitigation for california, is on tomorrow's (wed's) agenda. i will be patching in the meeting in a conference room here in portland. the meeting begins 7 a.m. pdt. based on yesterday's newspapers, staff's proposal appears to have a chance of adoption. however, what the ferc will do is very much up in the air. any mitigation plan will replace the current approach set to expire 4/30/01 that requires (1) cost reporting of all accepted bids over $150/mwh, and (2) refunds (subject to appeal) of generators who bid and are accepted above a index based on a heat rate and monthly gas price. staff's mitigation plan has been out since early march 2001. here's a rundown: o applies only in in-ca generators with agreements (pgas) selling to iso r/t. o applies only in stage 3 (although one of the easiest ""tweaks"" the ferc can do is make the staff proposal apply to stage 2/3 or stage 1/2/3) o iso r/t prices within the state will be ""mitigated"" (capped) at a single price based on the marginal cost of the last pga generator accepted. staff proposal states: ""pga generators would be required to propose to the commission, in advance, a dependable capacity for each unit as well as certain operating parameters necessary to calculate marginal costs, such as heat rate. the commission staff could then use a published fuel cost such as that which is available in gas daily and emission credit data (where applicable) to determine the correct price that can be used for mitigation purposes. this would then be the basis upon which the iso would use pre-determined standing prices to mitigate prices during times of reserve deficiency (e.g., stage 3)."" o it is not clear whether a daily or monthly index would be used. currently refund orders use a monthly index. o by ""single price"", not that everyone will get the in-state clearing price based upon the marginal cost of the last pga generator selected. o imports: the staff proposal punts on imports. i read staff proposal imply that there will be no mitigation on imports per se but that imports are likely to be taken on an oom basis more frequently when stage 3's are in effect. if you have any questions, please contact me. alan comnes."

(the public works department only has records over the last year because they changed their computer system and lost many files including mine.) for the last year or so i have been receiving a more positive response when i call which is: ""this is a code 1 priority and will schedule as work load allows."" although this response is encouraging, i still feel that my request is falling on deaf ears. kevin suggested that perhaps a call or letter to a city council person might help expedite this work request. i would be extremely grateful if there is anything you could do to help me and my neighbors. carol brown executive assistant office of the chairman enron broadband services, inc. - fax"

"radiowallstreet tuesday, october 17 enron wholesale & retail business hits record level enron beat the street as earnings climbed 31% thanks to online energy trading. third quarter revenue soared 154% to $30 billion. enron pres/coo jeffrey skilling tells radiowallstreet.com he believes crude oil prices will begin to fall in 2001. (ene) energy trading, enrononline help enron top 3rd quarter estimates by christina cheddar of dow jones newswires 10/17/2000 dow jones news service (copyright (c) 2000, dow jones & company, inc.) new york -(dow jones)- after once again helping enron corp. (ene) to top wall street's expectations, the importance of enron's energy trading operations was further cemented in the third quarter. enron's third-quarter earnings rose 31% to $292 million, or 34 cents a share, from $223 million, or 27 cents a share, before items, a year ago. third-quarter revenue rose 154% to $30 billion from $11.84 billion. in the year-ago period, enron's net income was $290 million, or 35 cents a share, after a gain of $345 million, or 44 cents a share, on the sale of its stake in enron oil & gas co. (eog), and a charge of $278 million, or 36 cents a share, on its mtbe asset. according to first call/thomson financial, analysts were expecting enron to earn 32 cents a share in the latest third quarter. the key driver of the company's performance was its wholesale business, which includes enrononline and commodity sales, and which has transformed enron from a gas pipeline company to the world's largest energy trader. in the third quarter, the wholesale business just had ""a stunning quarter,"" said enron president jeff skilling. revenue from enron's wholesale energy operations and services unit, which includes enrononline and commodity sales, more than doubled to $28.15 billion from $11.06 billion. income before interest, minority interest and taxes, or ibit, in the third quarter rose 66% to $627 million from $378 million a year ago. during the latest period, physical deliveries of energy commodities grew 64% to 53.5 trillion british thermal units, enron said. enrononline, the company's internet-based transaction system, is driving the growth of the wholesale segment, said raymond niles, an analyst at salomon smith barney. currently, more than 60% of the enron's wholesale business occurs through enrononline. as of oct. 11, enrononline had executed more than 350,000 transactions online, totaling $183 billion of gross value since its inception in late 1999. enrononline, which initially bought and sold natural gas, electricity, petrochemicals, and bandwidth, has expanded to other commodity areas such as metals and pulp and paper. j.p. morgan analyst anatol feygin supports enron's decision to expand to other commodities. ""the only limit (to expanding to other commodities) is intellectual capital,"" feygin said. he estimates that the north american steel business is a $35 billion business, while pulp and paper is about $150 billion. at least part of the success that enron had during the third quarter was the result of price volatility in california's deregulated energy market. however, the company wouldn't specify what it earned in the state. during the third quarter, utilities in the golden state paid near-record rates for electricity as higher demand pushed the power grid to the brink. ""the uncertainty and the volatility that we have been seeing in the electricity and the gas market has been beneficial to enron,"" said enron's skilling. california's situation is rather unique, he said. skilling expects californian electricity markets will improve as supply and demand fall into balance and other technical market questions are resolved. although enron posted strong earnings across the board, it is getting clearer that the company will look to divest itself of some of its international assets. according to a source familiar with the company, enron recently completed an analysis of its assets with the intent of identifying underperforming assets and improving capital efficiency. as a result of the analysis, some assets were marked for sale. skilling admitted the company would like to monetize some of its international assets, but he wouldn't say which assets are on the auction block. however, it is unlikely enron will sell its international gas pipelines because the assets receive a solid rate of return, skilling said. one asset that could be divested is enron's dabhol power project in maharashtra, india, said analysts. other power plants in italy and turkey also seem like logical candidates for sale. ""i think it makes a lot of sense for enron,"" said salomon's niles. ""enron is moving into markets where they are relying on intellectual capital rather than physical capital,"" he said. following this logic, assets such as the india power plant don't make as much sense as they once did. in some cases, the international assets are in countries that didn't open to competition as expected, explained zach wagner, an analyst at edward jones. since deregulation has been fueling enron's growth, it only makes sense that the company concentrate on open markets. furthermore, wagner believes the money enron will raise in the asset sales could be re-deployed to fund projects such as the company's venture with blockbuster inc.

(graphic: enron (ene) one-year stock chart) and joining us right now from houston to talk about the latest numbers and tell us what other changes are in store is jeff skilling, president and chief operating officer over at enron. jeff, congratulations this morning on your earnings report. so much has been made about your move into broadband but that's one area where you are still losing money, twenty million during the last quarter, correct? jeff skilling (president, chief operating officer; enron): well, david, it's a start-up business so we expect that over the next couple of years we will lose money in our bandwidth business. but we see in two, three years out in the future that that's likely to be a very significant business for us. chernoff: mr. skilling, let me add a question about the internet business because that is one area where enron does seem to be doing extremely well. you guys are trading energy right now, you're trading a whole bunch of other products right over the internet. how's it going and what sort of expansion do you see over there? skilling: well, as you mentioned, we had a big, big up-tick in revenues and i think a large portion of that is due to our on-line transaction business. since we brought it on-line last november--november 29, we've done over a hundred and eighty-five billion dollars of transactions, so it's been a big piece of the activity this year. david sowerby (guest host, loomis, sayles): je--jeff, the remarkable performance of your stock price in the last year and a half, two years, your price-to-earnings ratio is about--almost sixty times earnings. the average utility is trading at about twenty-five times earnings. what do you tell the investor today who's thinking about adding to enron with--with such--with such a high p/e ratio relative to your peer group? (graphic: enron corp. *market cap: $59.3b *52-week high: 90 *52-week low: 34 7/8) skilling: well, a--a big portion of the p/e ratio is the result of our broadband business. if you take out the portion of our--our equity valuation that's related to broadband, which is not generating any earnings, and look at just say our wholesale business, our wholesale business is selling for about a twenty-five to thirty multiple. so, we think, given the growth rates that we're seeing in the energy business and our wholesale business, that we have some significant upside on that valuation which we think will push our stock up overall. (graphic: enron ?? markets and trades: *electricity *natural gas *other commodities *99 revenues: $40b) chernoff: well, jeff, let's talk about that broadband aspect 'cause as you say, the market certainly is giving you a lot of credit for that but at the same time, over the past few weeks, there's been a debate on wall street as to whether we might actually be entering a broadband glut. is that a fantasy? (graphic: enron ?? *no. 1 u.s. buyer/seller of natural gas (provides energy consulting, construction & engineering services)) skilling: no, i think that's a very real possibility. (graphic: enron ?? *subsidiary enron broadband services building national fiber-optic network) and, in fact, we've designed our business to take advantage of that. you know, if you--if you look at the history of enron, we created markets for natural gas and electricity when those markets were in massive over-supply. and we some of the same characteristics in the--in the broadband business which is why we've begun building the capability to transact real time bandwidth so that when the market prices do decline, and i believe they'll decline pretty significantly, we'll be in a position to make that--that lower cost capacity available to our customers. (graphic: enron ?? commodities traded: *paper *coal *chemicals *fiber-optic bandwidth) chernoff: and in terms of data storage, i know you're looking at that area. are you guys pla--planning to go head-to-head with emc? what's going on over there? (graphic: enron ?? *32,000 miles of gas pipeline (fortune magazine: ranked ""most innovative co."" past 5 yrs)) skilling: well, it just seems like more and more businesses are turning into commodity businesses and that's what we do. we create markets for commodities and i--i wouldn't be at all surprised if you see data storage turn into a commodity where you'll be able to buy and sell it just like you buy and sell pork bellies on the--on the exchange.

(i'm going to check with the control engineers in rheine to assure my interpretation of this is correct.) here are some documents that describe how the parameters/set points relate to individual faults. this document describes the faults in some detail: this document shows the nominal values of the parameters for all turbine types.

"having worked on the enron advisory council process, i have one observation: consider having some or all of these individuals as ""guest speakers"" rather than formal memebers. you can still have them review information, do their homework, and tailor their remarks to enron specifics. also, you should definitely include paul portney at resources for the future. he sits on the enron advisory council and knows the company well. kelly communications sent by: stacy communications 03/01/2001 02:27 pm eddie elyse gene george gregory hap james a jean jimmy mariella miguel mark michael mitchell paula rick rob shelley steven j tim vicki cc: nicola mary lisa barbara zulie bert karina dortha connie melissa leena isabel beverley laura karen e rosario laura karen k debra ruth maureen marion leasa lauren catherine mckalip-thompson/enron communications, susan as we discussed at the last corporate responsibility task force meeting, one activity that we have underway is recruiting an external advisory council. this council will be comprised of global experts on environmental and social issues, from non-governmental organizations and potentially other businesses, to advise us on trends and issues in this area. an outline of the advisory council structure, along with categories of experts and proposed names is attached below. we expect to convene meetings with this group twice a year, inviting the enron executive committee and board of directors, as well as the corporate responsibility task force, to engage in a dialogue. we plan to present a slate of possible candidates to ken lay and jeff skilling later this month, and would appreciate your input and any ideas by march 16. thanks for your consideration."

"?? will it resources make a difference in what we need to deliver and how quickly we can do it? someone must be giving credit the idea that ""if only we had it resources..."" and that those resources are active on entelligence but are not helping us on other business basics. --sally ---------------------- forwarded by sally beck/hou/ect on 12/11/2000 02:36 pm --------------------------- cc: sally, i share your pain about increased deal flow. have you spoken with lavo about getting additional resources or is there a way to better allocate resources? is the entelligence database used by anybody? should we not focus those resources on gcp? i am getting hammered on the exposure questions. please help!!! bill enron north america corp. cc: mary james william s bradford/hou/ect i certainly agree that updated information from the wider company database should flow to update gcp. i assume that you have talked with both mary solmonson and james scribner about this process to understand the details. they are the logical experts for that discussion. your memo is a little vague on that, so if you are getting information from someone else and have not taken the time to talk with the best sources, i would suggest spending time with james and mary so that you and they are appropriately informed. absolutely there are procedures in place to handle these updates to gcp. i believe that these are pretty manual, as there are no systematic feeds from entelligence into gcp. james and mary (i refer to both because james has only recently assumed mary's duties within global databases) can best discuss how this process works. if you are aware of specific concerns around this, i know that james and mary will want to hear that from you. as is to be expected for any business that has experienced a 600% increase in the number of transactions year on year, there are challenges that we face daily in all of the tasks that we do. your input will help james in making sure that priorities are set and personnel are deployed to tackle the biggest issues that we have. i recognize the challenge that credit must be facing in aggregating exposures in our market environment today. with your input, we will do our very best to be certain that the data surrounding the 5.000+ deals that are done daily is as accurate as possible. 12/11/2000 11:42 am cc: shona avril mary james eric william s sally, i have been made aware of a disconnect between the data held in global counterparty and in global companies ( entelligence). much effort has been put forth in ""cleansing"" the parent/subsidiary information presented in entelligence, yet the same information is not being replicated in gcp except for on an ad hoc, manual basis. what is the standard for data population in gcp vs entelligence? should changes and corrections in entelligence not flow to gcp since our risk and trading systems are based on the information housed therein? what process and or systems enhancements are necessary to accomplish this end result? it appears we have a major gcp cleanup in the works while much of the work has been already been done for entelligence. as we struggle to report trading positions properly, let's take advantage of our in house knowledge and share counterparty data validation results in order to minimize research and data population efforts. your comments and ideas are welcome. debbie"

""the ball came out sharp,"" said offensive coordinator tom rossley. ""he was right on the money. i was pleased with what he did today."" if favre can stay in the game this sunday he could have a big day. the colts have one of the weaker pass defenses in the nfl, having allowed 15 td passes this season. frank sanders , wr ari - mean machine updated 11/16/00 sanders had his best game in five weeks last sunday, catching five passes for 82 yards in arizona's 31-14 loss to the vikings. he is currently battling a quadricep injury, but is listed as probable for this week's matchup with the eagles. it would be a wise move to bench sanders this week, especially against an aggressive philadelphia secondary. jake plummer , qb ari - fdic updated 11/16/00 plummer completed 19-of-28 passes for 219 yards last sunday against the vikings, but was held without a touchdown pass. in fact, ""the snake"" has thrown only one touchdown pass in the last four weeks. things won't get better for plummer this week against the eagles, who will blitz him relentlessly and likely force him to make bad decisions. troy brown , wr ne - fdic updated 11/16/00 brown caught only two passes for ten yards last sunday against the browns. although he has shown flashes of brilliance in the past, brown is far too inconsistent to be considered a starter by most fantasy league standards. adam vinatieri , k ne - free agent updated 11/16/00 vinatieri has connected on eight consecutive field goal attempts, dating back to week four against the dolphins. with new england's offense sputtering in recent weeks, don't expect much from vinatieri this week against the bengals. rod rutledge , te ne - free agent updated 11/16/00 rutledge caught three passes for 20 yards last sunday against the browns, including his first career touchdown. with the release of erich bjornson, he should become more involved in the patriots' offense in the coming weeks. if you relied on bjornson as your everday tight end, it would be a wise move to pickup rutledge. carl pickens , wr ten - the fat bastards updated 11/16/00 pickens was held out of practice yesterday because of his injured hamstring. he has missed four of his last six games, but coach jeff fisher says that he is improving. pickens will likely be a gametime decision. bashir yamini , wr ten - free agent updated 11/16/00 the titans may need to make a roster move with their injuries at wide receiver. one possibility is to sign yamini, who is on the practice squad and was on the roster earlier in the year, to replace chris jackson, who will be out for the remainder of the year with a herniated disc in his back. jackson had recently been signed off the practice squad. eddie george , rb ten - fear updated 11/16/00 george was able to participate fully in practice yesterday after receiving a cortisone shot for his injured right big toe earlier in the week. he plans on getting more involved in practice this week and hopes to get it strong enough to play sunday against cleveland. the only real concern here is whether george may develop turf toe, which could require surgery. keep a close eye on him, and be sure to insure your roster with his backup, rodney thomas. wade richey , k sf - free agent updated 11/16/00 richey has struggled recently missing four of his last six field-goal tries. last year richey made 21-of-23 attempts. he should get a lot of attempts this week against the falcons. san francisco should be able to move the chains against atlanta, but with terrell owens suffering from turf toe, the niners will have problems scoring touchdowns. fred beasley , rb sf - free agent updated 11/16/00 beasley missed last sunday's game because of left-knee and ankle injuries and remains questionable for this week. terry jackson will start at fullback if beasley is unable to play. in the beginning of the season the niners threw to beasley in goal-line situations. recently they have chosen to let charlie garner run the ball or to throw to their wideouts. beasley scored five touchdowns in the first three games, but has none since then. jerry rice , wr sf - thrill kill cult updated 11/16/00 rice sat out of practice wednesday to rest his sore back. he is expected to play this week and is listed as probable on the injury report. rice had five catches for 59 yards in the season opener against atlanta. at this point in his career rice has very little fantasy value. he is being used mainly for routes over the middle and as a decoy in goal line situations. chad dukes , rb stl - free agent updated 11/16/00 to add depth to its backfield, st. louis has signed dukes, who spent time on the redskins' roster earlier this season. dukes will probably be the backup halfback against the redskins monday behind justin watson. regular backup trung canidate is out for the season after breaking his right wrist sunday. az-zahir hakim , wr stl - ramiro updated 11/16/00 hakim is suffering from a fractured rib but head coach mike martz said he will play against the redksins monday. this week's matchup could be the ultimate test for the rams' receiving team this week as they go up against one of the best secondaries in the league. start all of your rams receivers as usual but don't be surprised if some of them struggle. andrew glover , te no - free agent updated 11/16/00 glover sat out practice tuesday with a sore back and is listed as probable for sunday's game against the raiders. he may catch a lot of passes against his former team this week. the saints are thin on offense, with ricky williams and jake reed sidelined by injury, so glover could get a lot of balls thrown his way. the raiders have been succeptible to tight end routes this season. denver tes combined for 125 yards and a td against them last week. kansas city te tony gonzalez had nine catches for 134 yards against oakland in week 10. chris hetherington , rb car - free agent updated 11/16/00 hetherington will make the second start of his five-year career sunday against the vikings. hetherington will be filling in for the injured william floyd who suffered broken ribs last week. he is not as gifted offensively as floyd though, and will be used primarily for blocking assignments. kris mangum , te car - free agent updated 11/16/00 mangum exited last sunday's game after the first quarter and did not return due to a sprained shoulder. mangum's shoulder has allowed him to be more flexible in practice and he appeared to be ready for this week's game at minnesota. ""we'll see,"" mangum told the rock hill herald . ""i tried last week. i guess i came back a little early. we'll try again this week and see what happens."" mangum was supposed to start at tight end in place of the injured wesley walls but his shoulder ailment has sidelined him as well. rookie casey crawford will start at te once again if mangum is unable to play sunday. brad hoover , rb car - free agent updated 11/16/00 hoover has been working out with the first team this week in preparation for a possible start against the vikings sunday. starter tim biakabutuka is suffering from turf toe and is questionable for the game at minnesota. at this point in the season selecting hoover would be a gamble, even if he does start sunday. carolina hasn't run the ball too well this season, averaging 79.4 yards per game. it might be safer to use a starting back from another team even if the player hasn't been too productive. jon kitna , qb sea - ramiro updated 11/16/00 kitna was named the afc's offensive player of the week yesterday after passing for three touchdowns in seattle's 28-21 victory over jacksonville. his reward? a return to the bench, in all likelihood. he is expected to be the backup to brock huard after the bye in a november 26th game against the denver broncos. terrell owens , wr sf - fear updated 11/16/00 owens is still bothered by the turf toe injury that limited his playing time in the team's 21-7 win over kansas city. head coach steve mariucci is seriously considering holding owens out of this week's game. owens still leads the nfl in td receptions with 11 and is third in catches, but the turf toe injury could slow him down for the rest of the season. if he can't play sunday wideout j.j. stokes would make his second straight start in place of him. ryan leaf , qb sd - free agent updated 11/16/00 leaf may now get the starting nod for this week's game against denver. head coach mike riley stated earlier in the week that jim harbaugh would be the starter, but now says that he will wait a day or two before making a decision. look elsewhere for a quarterback this week if your roster allows it. jim harbaugh , qb sd - free agent updated 11/16/00 harbaugh was named the starter for sunday's game against the broncos earlier in the week, but head coach mike riley may now be retracting that statement. ryan leaf took an equal number of snaps as harbaugh in practice on wednesday, and may get the nod on sunday. riley said that he plans to wait another day or two before announcing a starter. if at all possible, go with another quarterback this week. jaguars , dt jac - the snake pit updated 11/16/00 jacksonville will be without linebackers hardy nickerson and lonnie marts, and probably without cornerback aaron beasley, for sunday's game in pittsburgh. nickerson, who missed three games with a hamstring injury and the last two recovering from knee surgery, went to california yesterday for a second opinion and could be out a few more weeks. marts is still recovering from a groin injury, and beasley is listed as questionable with a back injury but is unlikely to play. rookie t.j. slaughter, erik storz and jason craft would get the starts at their respective positions. pittsburgh has a subpar passing game, but its running game, led by jerome bettis, could give the jaguars' defense fits come sunday. tyrone wheatley , rb oak - the lie downs updated 11/16/00 wheatley is listed as questionable for sunday's game against the saints. he didn't play in monday night's loss to the broncos, and will be re-evaluated by head coach jon gruden during practice the rest of the week. oakland is reportedly talking about signing running back terry kirby for this week's game, which could be a bad sign if you have wheatley on your fantasy roster. more updates transactions?nfl reports?

"goldwyn cc: bcc: gentlemen: as you may have heard, i am assuming responsibility for heading up the government/regulatory affairs efforts beyond my current turf of europe to include africa, asia, australia. this is why i generated an early e-mail on the gaza project. i am now trying to meet with my new team members, and clients/customers in the organisation. i am headed to houston on sunday, for 3 days of meetings, and first week of march begin a journey that will take me to most parts of east asia/australia. any suggestions on how (where) we get together, and do you think it is a high priority, or not urgent. it is not that i am looking to avoid a trip, but e-mails like those below suggest that i can be kept well-informed without flying somewhere just to say ""hello"". i know mac is in dubai. i can fly there, or you can come to london (or are there others i should also meet in dubai?). andrew - where are you based? if in dubai, then does it make sense for me to come to you? sooner rather than later, or no urgency? if in houston, should we try to meet next week? or are you in still some other location? your thoughts/views are appreciated. thanks mcs andrew 09/02/2000 17:03 cc: mark joe steven j scott lora chris rick jeffrey terence h @ enron_development goldwyn mac- i have a slightly different view on your point #4. the israelis are actually pushing for a palestinian water project as it will greatly strengthen the israeli position in the land settlement discussions in the peace talks. the pna is saying that they need more land in the west bank in order to gain more access to aquifers under the land. the isaelis want a desal project for the pna so that they can claim that the pna has a larger water base, and thus does not need to have more land for access to more water. the issue is that there is not practical way in which gaza generated water can efficiently reach the west bank, thus a water project in gaza should really be a moot point in this discussion, although it will not be due to the lack of rationale to their discussions. i think that it is worth pointing out that the us consulate and embassy in israel have been helpful to us. from the macro level, there needs to be more proactive cooperation between the pna and goi on this project (due to the logistical and technical reasons that mac pointed out below). furthermore, it it worth noting that the pna need to be more willing to adapt their standards to be more in line with large international transactions, as the local process that they wish to cling to is very cumbersome, and will not benefit the pna by attracting large scale foreign investment. please let me know if you wish to discuss this further. andrew enron international lora chris cc: rick andrew jeffrey terence h @ enron_development goldwyn the ipp in gaza is progressing albeit somewhat behind schedule. this combined cycle power plant is the first infrastructure development project in gaza and the first by a major western company anywhere in ""palestine."" there are several issues which should be addressed and may be raised during the secretary's visit. 1. all equipment for the plant must transit israel. we have been assured by the israelis that movement of the equipment will not be impeded as long as it is on the list of equipment we provide them. that said, there are countless opportunities for equipment to be delayed in israel awaiting clearance, whether on the list or not. first power could be delayed indefinitely if the israelis choose to do so for political, security, or other reasons. 2. fuel for the plant, once operational, will also transit israel. again, disruption of the fuel supply for any length of time will in effect pull the plug on power in gaza. gas from egypt has been discussed; it remains to be seen if that will be a reality anytime soon. 3. although not officially from the israeli government, we have been told that as soon as the first watt of power from the plant is produced, the israelis will turn off supply of electricity to gaza. the current consumption is about 110mw. the first phase of the plant will produce 40mw. this appears to be the beginning of a power supply arrangement whereby israel sells gaza electricity to make up the difference. that electricity is likely to be more expensive than that which the plant will supply; enron could well end up being blamed for the higher cost. 4. water is another critical issue. the palestinians want their own supply of fresh water which must necessarily be desalinated. israel is currently selling water to gaza; it is not in israel's best interest to lose this customer, therefore she may attempt to delay a desalination project. 5. opic project funding is problematical. since they originally invited enron to take on this project, they should necessarily also be involved. lack of opic support could jeopardize other project financing and drive up costs. 6. the israelis must also ""approve"" the environmental impact of the plant. the plant will meet or exceed world bank guidelines, more so when operating on gas. while not a probem at this point, the israelis could delay construction/operation over environmental ""concerns."" andrew is the lead developer for this project and may have other issues for consideration. thanks. mac ---------------------- forwarded by mac mcclelland/enron_development on 02/09/2000 08:28 pm --------------------------- cc: joe steven j mac scott lora goldwyn mark - good suggestion. i spoke to scott rebltiz who told me that important decisions are to made this week at opic concering the gaza project. i will work with scott and john hardy to make sure that our message is consistent and helpful. i will also work with mac for a comprehensive update and strategy. -chris mark 02/09/2000 06:35 am cc: steven j mac joe?chris - this covers some of my new turf. we have, i am told, a power project in gaza that we are working on. it is probably early days, but perhpas mac mcclelland in dubai can shed some light on whether we would want to get that project on the secretary of energy's radar screen. mcs ---------------------- forwarded by mark schroeder/lon/ect on 09/02/2000 11:33 --------------------------- enron capital & trade resources corp. cc: director of programs ph: , ext. 224 fx: pre-departure briefing bciu and the u.s. department of energy are pleased to announce an industry briefing with: assistant secretary of energy david goldwyn in preparation for energy secretary bill richardson's middle east trip (egypt, israel, palestinian authority, kuwait, and saudi arabia) time: 10:30 a.m. - 11:30 a.m. place: department of energy room 7c016 1000 independence avenue, s.w. washington, dc 20036 secretary of energy bill richardson is visiting the middle east february 19-26 where he will meet with officials in egypt, israel, the palestinian authority, kuwait and saudi arabia. he is expected to sign bilateral science and technology agreements (or annexes to existing agreements) focused on solar and renewable energy, advanced power systems, and/or electric vehicle programs with egypt and israel, as well as an energy cooperation agreement with the palestinian authority. he will meet the leaderships of kuwait and saudi arabia on international oil company involvement in the upstream oil sector and other issues important to u.s. industry. bciu invites you to join department of energy assistant secretary for international affairs david goldwyn, deputy assistant secretary theresa fariello, special assistant to secretary richardson for policy rachel king, and director for nis, russia and middle east affairs len coburn for an industry roundtable in preparation for this visit. companies are encouraged to bring background material for the secretary's use during the trip to this meeting if they have not been provided to the department of energy previously. if you have any questions regarding this program, please contact jeffrey donald at tel. , fax: ;

"sorry- here is the whole story - the last email was cut off usa: interview-enron impatient at power deregulation pace. by chris baltimore 10/12/2001 reuters english news service (c) reuters limited 2001. washington, oct 12 (reuters) - nearly 10 years after congress passed the energy policy act in 1992 to promote competition in the nation's $220 billion wholesale power market, enron corp is growing impatient. from the u.s. supreme court to congress and the federal energy regulatory commission, the houston-based energy and commodities trading giant has spread its open-market gospel. ""five years ago we clearly thought we would be much farther along than we are now,"" rick shapiro, enron's managing director of government affairs, told reuters in an interview on friday. ""finishing the job of making wholesale markets work across the u.s. is our number one objective,"" shapiro said. enron has a large stake in the regulatory debate. with wide-ranging commodity positions from lumber to pulp to bandwidth, oil and natural gas, its strategy hinges on the ability to transfer those products from buyer to seller more cheaply and quickly than its competitors. for the power market, that means enron needs easy access to electric transmission lines, the interstate highway system that allows it to wheel supplies between regions and capitalize on short-term price imbalances. utilities block competition enron's big problem? traditional utilities own transmission lines and have shaped the rules to block new entrants and favor their own generation, shapiro said. ""vertically integrated monopolies have been very effective in delaying wholesale competition across the board,"" he said. in its pleas to supreme court justices and regulators, enron has tried to empower federal regulators to force utilities to open their wires to competition. the supreme court last week heard oral arguments in a case that could be a watershed for the u.s. power industry and decide whether ferc has the right to drive competition on state transmission networks. in a classic battle of state versus federal jurisdictional turf, enron wants the court to give ferc more authority to compel states to open their transmission grids to competitors. meanwhile, new york has brought a companion case that says ferc has gone too far and the court should give control of transmission wires back to the states. ""this is an example of an agency that has overstepped its bounds,"" lawrence malone, general counsel for the new york state public service commission, said at the oral argument. new york wants the court to revoke ferc's authority to regulate retail sales, contending electricity involved in such sales stays within state boundaries and is not subject to federal legislation. ""i think a victory for new york would be absolutely disastrous for consumers across the country,"" shapiro said. ""ferc has jurisdiction. all they need to do is exercise it,"" shapiro said, echoing enron lawyers' case to supreme court justices that existing laws give ferc the power to do enron's will. enron does not see a recent congressional push for energy legislation as key to its plans, shapiro said. ""ferc is doing its job on the electricity front. i'm not sure that legislation is required on that front."" ferc shows promising signs with new chairman pat wood at the helm, ferc is moving in the right direction to drive competition, shapiro said. ""it's early in his tenure,"" shapiro said of wood. ""many of the signs are promising."" wood has made so-called regional transmission organizations a high priority and set aggressive agency rules to drive utilities to join them. rtos establish common rules that allow utilities to smoothly trade bulk electricity across the borders of their own local transmission systems. enron sees rtos as a positive step toward competition. in what he called a ""carrots and sticks"" approach, wood signaled in late september that utilities must either join rtos or face losing the right to sell power in wholesale markets. ferc will hold a week-long meeting on rtos beginning monday. enron is skeptical that carrots are useful, and is a bigger fan of sticks, shapiro said. utilities have ""gotten quite fat over the last nine or 10 years,"" shapiro said, and will shrug off ferc's incentives.

(1/9/01) in a 3-2 vote, the puc told verizon that it must agree to a permanent assurance plan with ""self-executing"" remedies based on the new york model already accepted by the fcc and to increased penalties for failure to meet performance standards. verizon said that it will accept these conditions and that it plans to file its interlata bid with the fcc ""shortly."" commissioners nora mead brownell and terrance j. fitzpatrick dissented. commissioner brownell said, ""i cannot, in good conscience, affirm that these markets are open as envisioned under the [federal telecommunications act of 1996]."" both dissenting commissioners listed several areas in which verizon had failed to meet the fcc requirements to determine that local markets are open to competition. a worldcom, inc., spokesman told tr, ""we agree with the dissenters and hope the fcc will recognize that problems still exist and force verizon to fix them prior to allowing them to offer long distance."" once verizon files its market-entry bid with the fcc, the puc will present its recommendation. section 271 of the act requires the fcc to consult with the u.s. department of justice and relevant state regulators before ruling on such applications. (docket no. m-00001435, consultative report on application of verizon pennsylvania inc., for fcc authorization to provide in- region, interlata service in pennsylvania) ______________________________________________________ connecticut -- snet challenges city's telecom certification southern new england telecommunications (snet) has filed an appeal in superior court (new britain) challenging the department of public utility control's decision to grant the city of groton a certificate to provide telecom access services. (docket no. 00-03-12) snet argues that groton ""is not legally empowered to offer telecommunications services to those who are not inhabitants of its electric service area"" under connecticut general statutes =0f5 7-233i. groton's customers as defined in its application would all be noninhabitants, snet said. in its april 11 decision, the dpuc agreed with groton's argument that ""[the statute] has no language prohibiting a municipality from offering wholesale telecommunications service."" ______________________________________________________ tennessee -- bellsouth to ask tra to support market-entry bid soon bellsouth telecommunications, inc., has notified the regulatory authority that it plans to request support for its bid to enter the tennessee interlata (local access and transport area) market ""by the end of july."" compliance with the 14-point ""competitive checklist"" of section 271 of the federal telecommunications act is a prerequisite for fcc authorization to provide in-region interlata service. the fcc must consult with the u.s. department of justice and relevant state regulators before ruling on the applications. bellsouth asked the tra to schedule hearings on its application for the first week of november. bellsouth asked the tra to support its section 271 bid in 1997, but the company withdrew the request before the tra could decide whether to endorse it, a tra staff member told tr. ______________________________________________________ michigan -- psc adopts '616' area code 'split' the public service commission yesterday approved a geographic ""split"" to relieve number exhaustion in the ""616"" area code. a north/south geographic split will be implemented with a dividing line that follows the northern boundaries of saugatuck, hamilton, hopkins, wayland, middleville, hastings, and woodland rate centers. customers in and to the south of these rate centers will receive a new area code. customers to the north of the rate centers will retain 616. permissive dialing will begin by july 13, 2002, and mandatory dialing will begin feb. 15, 2003. wireless carriers will have an extended permissive dialing period through feb. 15, 2004. (case no. u-12850) ______________________________________________________ new york -- nassau county restricts use of wireless phones nassau county today enacted an ordinance requiring the use of hands-free devices when operating wireless phones while driving. ""although mobile phones provide convenience for our busy lives, their use must conform with the need for public safety,"" nassau county executive thomas gulotta said. emergency calls to police, fire, ambulance, or health care providers are exempt from the requirement. the ordinance authorizes the police department to fine up to $100 per violation, a nassau county spokesperson told tr. the ordinance takes effect july 1. ______________________________________________________ west virginia -- verizon to appeal $18m access-rate reduction verizon west virginia, inc., yesterday said it plans to ask the public service commission to reconsider an order requiring verizon to reduce its access rates by $18 million over three years. the psc's order addressed an at&t corp. complaint. while the reduction is smaller than the $27.6 million suggested by at&t, it's larger than the $6 million cut verizon proposed. verizon said that, if given the chance, it would demonstrate that the psc was ""misguided in seeking to mirror in-state and interstate access rates."" the telco said the order gives at&t and other long distance companies a free ride on its network at the expense of consumers. the psc ordered the access charge reductions to be passed through to west virginia toll customers. verizon responded, ""people shouldn't hold their breath waiting for at&t to pass along any savings."" (case no. 00-0318-t-c, at&t communications of west virginia, inc. v. bell atlantic-west virginia, inc.) ______________________________________________________ california -- wood proposes 'anticramming' rules public utilities commissioner charles wood has proposed rules to regulate the inclusion of noncommunications charges on phone bills. existing law, which authorizes only communications- related charges on phone bills, is scheduled to expire july 1. (1/5/01) the proposed rules are designed to prevent ""cramming,"" which is the placement of unauthorized charges on phone bills. the proposed rules require telecom companies to obtain a customer's written consent before including noncommunications charges on phone bills. customers may revoke their consent at any time without charge and may identify a dollar maximum per charge and per billing cycle on noncommunications charges. telecom companies may not disconnect or threaten to disconnect basic local phone service for nonpayment of noncommunications charges. under the proposed rules, telecom companies must take ""reasonable"" precautions to screen vendors and billing agents before agreeing to provide noncommunications billing services for them. noncommunications charges must be identified in a separate section of phone bills. comments are due june 20. (rulemaking 00-02-004) ______________________________________________________ missouri -- house passes rights-of-way bill the house has passed a bill restricting local governments' authority to regulate public rights-of-way. the measure now goes to gov. bob holden (d.). southwestern bell telephone co. and competitive local exchange carriers support the bill, but the missouri municipal league ""fought the bill tooth and nail,"" a league spokesperson told tr. sb 369 would prohibit local governments from requiring telecom companies to obtain a franchise to use rights-of-way but would grandfather franchise agreements in effect may 1. the bill would prohibit rights-of-way rental fees but would authorize local governments to impose rights-of-way permit fees, which would be limited to ""actual, substantiated costs reasonably incurred"" in managing the public rights-of-way. local governments would have to process rights-of-way permit applications within 31 days after receiving a complete application. telecom and cable tv companies would be authorized to identify rights-of-way permit fees on customer bills. ______________________________________________________ georgia -- worldcom says fx calls subject to 'recip comp' worldcom, inc., has asked the public service commission to determine that calls originated by bellsouth telecommunications, inc.'s customers to competitive local exchange carriers' foreign- exchange (fx) customers should be considered local and therefore subject to reciprocal compensation. proper treatment of fx traffic is required to meet item 13 (reciprocal compensation) of section 271 of the federal telecommunications act of 1996's 14- point ""competitive checklist,"" mci said. treating clecs' fx traffic as long distance provides ""significant competitive advantages"" to bellsouth because it permits bellsouth to assess access charges on local calls and ""shields bellsouth's local fx service from competition,"" worldcom said. (docket no. 6863-u) ______________________________________________________ california -- alj suggests requiring pacific bell to permit intralata toll presubscription administrative law judge karen jones has recommended that the public utilities commission require pacific bell to permit mcimetro access transmission services llc's customers to presubscribe to pacific bell's intralata (local access and transport area) long distance service. the recommendation was made in a draft arbitrator's report about the companies' interconnection agreement. pacific bell said the requirement would be confusing to customers and would require the company to identify a separate billing channel or generate a bill solely for intralata long distance service. ""it is blatantly discriminatory for pacific to refuse to provide intralata toll service to mci's local service customers,"" ms. jones said. she said, ""pacific's arguments of 'customer confusion' and 'billing' concerns do not have merit."" ""customers could receive three different bills for the three different services, and other carriers cope with billing for only one of those three services. there is no reason that pacific should not be able to provide a bill which includes only intralata services."" comments on the draft arbitrator's report are due june 20. (application 01-01-010) ______________________________________________________ california -- puc extends deadline for pacific bell interlata filing public utilities commissioner geoffrey brown has extended pacific bell's deadline for filing information demonstrating its compliance with the interlata (local access and transport area) market-entry requirements of section 709.2 of california code. the section requires the puc to find that permitting pacific bell to enter the california interlata market doesn't harm the long distance market substantially. the commission also must find that pacific bell's entry is based on fully open local exchange access and that the company isn't engaging in anticompetitive behavior or improper cross-subsidization. (5/7/01) pacific bell asked the puc to extend the deadline from june 4 until ""mid-june,"" when the company plans to file its section 271 application with the puc. mr. brown granted the company's request and said he would establish a comment filing schedule after pacific has filed its section 709.2 assessment and section 271 application. (rulemaking nos. 93-04-003 and 95-04-043 and investigation nos. 93-04-002 and 95-04-044) ______________________________________________________ iowa -- board mulls revoking ltds's certificate the utilities board has ordered ltds corp. to demonstrate why its operating certificate shouldn't be revoked. the board is concerned that ""actions on the part of ltds do not appear to be the actions of a bona fide competitive local exchange carrier."" the board said there appears to be no voice traffic from or to an ltds customer in any exchange other than fairfield. the company ordered and then cancelled orders for voice trunks in the pella, chariton, and centerville exchanges. it ordered trunks in the grinnell and sigourney exchanges, although it has no assigned ""nxx"" codes there. the company's tariff also fails to include a residential rate. it was deleted in a jan. 19 tariff revision, the board said. it said state law obligates each local exchange utility to serve all eligible customers within the utility's service territory, unless explicitly excepted from the requirement by the board.

(richardson's statement and fpa section 202(c) order is posted on doe's web site at: ) 2. ferc's 12/15/00 final order to fix california wholesale markets (ferc's order can be viewed at california supplies ordered by richardson o richardson orders listed entities to supply excess power to california iso o order is effective as soon as iso certifies shortage, but ends 12/21/00, unless extended o prices to be agreed to by supplier and iso, or ferc will set rate later o fpa emergency power authority transferred to doe in 1977 as he said he would on december 13, u.s. department of energy secretary bill richardson found ""an emergency exists in california by reason of the shortage of electric energy"" and issued an emergency order under section 202 (c) of the federal power act (fpa) requiring listed generators and marketers to provide any power in excess of the needs of their firm customers to the california iso. in a statement, richardson said the threat to the reliability of the california grid requires a long-term solution, but that in the short-term power must keep flowing to the state to avert blackouts. the 76 listed suppliers have 12 hours after the iso certifies to doe that it has been unable to acquire adequate supplies in the market to begin providing requested service to the iso. the iso must inform each supplier subject to the order of the amount and type of energy or services required by 9:00 pm, eastern standard time, the day before the services are needed. the order directs the iso to allocate, to the extent feasible, requested services among subject entities in proportion to each supplier's available excess power. the order is effective immediately and will terminate at 3:00 am, eastern time, december 21, 2000, unless extended. to continue to obtain supplies under this emergency authority, the iso must re-certify the shortage to doe headquarters every 24 hours. the terms of the provision of electric energy and other services by suppliers to the iso ""are to be agreed to by the parties."" if no agreement is reached, then under the fpa's emergency authority secretary richardson ""will immediately prescribe the conditions of service and refer the rate issue to the federal energy regulatory commission for a determination at a later date by that agency in accordance with its standards and procedures, and will prescribe by supplemental order such rates as it finds to be just and reasonable."" the authority of ferc to set rates for power supplied under emergency order at just and reasonable levels where the parties themselves do not agree to a rate is explicitly included in fpa section 202(c). the doe organization act of 1997 transferred the emergency powers of this section from ferc to doe. the 76 entities identified in the order's attachment are all the entities that have provided power to the iso over the last 30 days. those entities are ordered ""to make arrangements to generate, deliver, interchange, and transmit electric energy when, as, and in such amounts as may be requested by the"" iso, ""acting as agent for and on behalf of scheduling coordinators."" [source: doe secretary richardson's december 14, 2000 statement and order; electric power daily, december 15, 2000] ferc de-federalizes california markets, adopts other structural reforms a summary of the december 15 order and commission discussion at its special meeting today, ferc unanimously approved its eagerly awaited final order reforming the california wholesale markets, adopting the major outlines of its november 1 proposed order and sending back to california the responsibility for addressing state-related matters, as discussed below. at the same time, ferc deferred consideration of retroactive refund issues as well as the imposition of region-wide price caps. ferc reiterated the november 1 conclusions that under certain circumstances, california ratepayers were subjected to unjust and unreasonable power rates due to california's ""seriously flawed"" market structure and rules in conjunction with tight demand and supply conditions throughout the west. while all four commissioners supported the order as a consensus-based outcome that appropriately balanced all competing interests, each commissioner expressed reservations with particular aspects of the order. chairman hoecker and comm. breathitt expressed the strongest endorsement, while comms. hebert and massey laid out their positions where they believed the commission had either ""over-reached"" or not gone far enough, just as they did on november 1, as discussed below. highlights of key actions: (1) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to eliminate, effective immediately, the state's mandatory requirement that the state's investor-owned utilities buy and sell electricity through the px, and allow these utilities to purchase electricity through forward contracts and other alternative mechanisms to manage supply risks. ferc terminated the px's rate schedules effective at the close of business on april 30, 2001. in effect, as chairman hoecker stated, the order de-federalizes 60 percent of the california wholesale market established under the state's restructuring law, returning ratemaking authority over company-owned generation to the california public utilities commission (cpuc). (2) ferc modified the effective period of the november 1 $150/mwh ""soft cap"" proposal, limiting its application through april 2001, whereupon a ""comprehensive and systematic monitoring and mitigation program which incorporates appropriate thresholds, screen and mitigation measures"" must be in place. in a related move, ferc ordered a technical conference early next year to develop such a program by march 1, 2001, so that these measures can be place by the may 1, deadline. in a major modification, ferc revised the refund conditions to clarify that while certain refund conditions will continue to apply, unless ferc issues written notification to the seller that its transaction is still under review, refund potential on a transaction will close after 60 days. as proposed, however, supply bids in excess of $150 will be prohibited from setting the market-clearing price for all bidders and sellers bidding above $150/mwh will be required to report their bids to ferc on a confidential, weekly basis and provide certain cost support. (3) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require the establishment of independent, non-stakeholder governing board for the iso. the iso governing board must relinquish their decision-making power and operating control to the iso management on january 29, 2001. a future order will set procedures for discussion with state representatives on the board selection process. (4) in a major modification, ferc adopted a $74/mwh ""price benchmark"" for assessing prices of five-year energy supply contracts. this benchmark will be used in assessing any complaints regarding justness and reasonableness of pricing long-term contracts. to facilitate prompt negotiation of longer term power contracts at reasonable rates, ferc announced that it will hold a settlement conference with market participants. (5) ferc adopted the november 1 proposal to require market participants to schedule 95 percent of their transactions in the day-ahead market and instituting a penalty charge for under-scheduling (in excess of five percent of hourly load requirements), in order to discourage over-reliance on the real-time spot market. (6) ferc directed the iso and the three investor-owned utilities to file generation interconnection standards. (7) ferc affirmed the longer-term measures proposed in the november 1 order, including submission of a congestion management design proposal by april 2, 2001. (8) ferc deferred resolving key issues, including establishing new iso board selection procedures, developing appropriate market monitoring measures and negotiating protective orders associated with data collection. (9) ferc reiterated its november 1 call to california policy makers there to resolve state issues, such as: (1) immediately implementing the availability of day ahead markets for power purchases; (2) development of demand responses; (3) siting of generation and transmission; and (4) assurance of sufficient reserve requirements. commissioner responses comm. hebert reluctantly concurred, calling the final order a ""missed opportunity"" to, among other things, send appropriate signals for new generation siting and conservation. reiterating his november 1 concerns, hebert recounted the remedial remedies that he maintained the commission should and should not have adopted. while expressing pleasure at the tone of the order (""balanced and considerate""), the bid certainly reversal, and the role reserved for the state in the selection of the new iso board, hebert nonetheless objected to the benchmark prices established in the order, which he maintained appeared to be unreasonably low. hebert faulted the commission for not attempting to reconcile the instant order with the november 8 order approving the ca iso's emergency $250/mwh ""soft cap"" proposal. hebert ended by challenging the cpuc to do what it can to encourage utilities there to forward contract, including easing the existing prudence review requirements. comm. breathitt endorsed the order, reiterating her support for progress towards open and competitive markets. she noted that the order properly ""walked the line"" by taking all of the competing interests into account, calling it less than ideal, but a step in the right direction. she also concentrated her remarks on the importance of creating stability which will be accomplished by encouraging long term contracts and the implementation of the $150/mwh breakpoint. additionally she mentioned that any price below the $74/mwh benchmark will be presumed just and reasonable. comm. massey concurred, but prefaced his remarks by expressing sympathy for california ratepayers, stating that he felt that market power had been exercised, that prices were not just and reasonable and that the marketers had profited too much at the expense of others in the market. he warned that, as he understood the legal precedents, the federal courts were poised to grant cost recovery relief to the retailers which would then be passed on to consumers. on the positive side, he approved of the de-federalization of 60% of the market and the creation of long term contracts. however, he emphasized that california regulators must now take the responsibility of creating more generation and transmission. in the long term, comm. massey hoped that solutions could be reached starting with a technical conference and that the market would have rules more like pjm. finally, comm. massey articulated what he would have liked to have done differently. he stated that he disagreed with the fact that there is not enough evidence to show that market power existed and he pointed to the on-going investigation. he also disagreed with the $150/mwh breakpoint, preferring instead a hard price per generator. the commissioner said he would have set the long term benchmark for only two years instead of five and that he would have opened a section 206 investigation in the west. finally, he stated that he would have liked to address the issue of refunds. chairman hoecker began his comments by saying that the commission was forced to act and act quickly because the stakes are so high. he feels that it is now time for the state regulators and markets to act. he noted that by shrinking the cal px, the responsibility is now with the cpuc to fashion the long term contracts and that hopefully we will exit this situation with the least amount of damage to the utilities. in regards to suggestions for a regional price cap, the chairman stated that this would not work due to the fact that the commission has no jurisdiction over bonneville, wapa and the public power producers and that there is no spot market in the northwest. however, he did urge secretary richardson to convene a conference in order to address regional issues. finally, in conceptually addressing the california situation, the chairman stated that competition or ""deregulation"" did not fail in california, but that there never was competition in california."

(ene) and occidental petroleum corp. (oxy) who are bidding jointly, marathon oil canada inc. (t.m), conoco inc. (coca) and phillips petroleum (p). the three ventures on offer have been estimated at a combined value of about $25 billion. saudi arabia invited international oil companies in october 1998 to participate in proposals for downstream gas projects and upstream gas enhancement. -by dyala sabbagh, dow jones newswires; 9; post mortem missing link by claire poole 05/03/2001 the daily deal copyright (c) 2001 the deal llc buying illinova gave dynegy a key piece in a puzzle for trading energy anywhere, anytime. when chuck watson decided to take his company beyond natural gas trading, he changed its name to dynegy inc. and took as its logo a tangram, a seven-piece puzzle that can be assembled in thousands of ways. buying utility illinova corp. in february 2000, gave him a piece for delivering such flexibility. ""the illinova acquisition was probably the most well-timed and best conceived buy of the year,"" raves jeremy butler, an analyst at value line publishing inc. reportcard dynegy -- illinova stock price a profitability b+ strategy a- braintrust b culture b competitive position a overall a- why? besides providing electricity to 650,000 customers in a 15,000-square-mile area in illinois, decatur, ill.-based illinova also had recently received regulatory approval to transfer its coal and gas-fired generating plants -- 3,800 megawatts in all -- to an unregulated subsidiary as part of the state's deregulation of its electricity industry. thanks to soaring energy prices, as well as to $125 million to $165 million in overall earnings estimated or achieved from optimizing illinova's generation assets and improving its operating efficiencies, dynegy is seeing the effects of the deal on its bottom line. ""illinova has been extremely accretive to earnings,"" said m. carol coale, an analyst at prudential securities in houston. last year, in fact, dynegy's revenues nearly doubled to $29.4 billion, while its net earnings almost tripled to $452 million, or $1.43 per diluted share, as a result of the $4 billion illinova deal. in the first quarter, dynegy's net earnings jumped 73%. investors have been amply rewarded. dynegy's stock took off last year, jumping 135% to $56.06 per share, making it the second best performing stock in the standard & poor's 500. since the illinova deal was announced june 14, 1999, dynegy's stock has skyrocketed an astounding 207%, from $18.25 to $56.11. (one of those happy investors is san francisco-based oil and gas giant chevron corp., which owns about 27% of dynegy.) for watson, who formed dynegy in the late 1990s out of houston energy company ngs corp., where he was ceo and chairman, the success of the illinova deal underscores his quest to take power and trade it anywhere he wants, anytime he wants, at any price he wants. that's why he dubbed the company dynegy, a hybrid name taken by combining ""dynamic"" with ""energy."" if energy prices stay high and dynegy's traders continue to make winning bets, analysts expect the company's net earnings per share to increase another 25% this year to $575 million, or $1.80 per share. but dynegy hasn't been immune to the power crisis afflicting california, where it co-owns four power plants with nrg energy inc. of minneapolis that generate 2,800 megawatts of capacity. indeed, since the crisis began, dynegy's been defending itself against allegations that it's overcharging for power. the california situation has hurt dynegy in other ways, too. on april 6, for example, its stock fell 5%, to $48.34, after utility pacific gas & electric co., a unit of pg&e corp., filed for bankruptcy. (dynegy provides power to the california market as a wholesaler but not to pg&e directly.) dynegy has also been quibbling recently with another teetering california utility, sempra energy's san diego gas & electric, which claimed april 12 that dynegy ordered it to shutter some of the facilities the utility sold it in 1999 -- but that it still operates -- because it doesn't think it will get paid. dynegy denied the charge. ""dynegy did not instruct sdg&e to shut down generating units, nor did we suggest that we would not make power available to creditworthy buyers,"" stephen w. bergstrom, dynegy's president and coo, wrote in a letter to sdg&e chairman and ceo stephen baum. dynegy has tried to downplay its exposure to the state's power woes. it's repeatedly pointed out to the press that its 50% stake in the four power plants in california only represents 1,400 of its total generating portfolio of 13,000 megawatts, or about 10.8%. analysts, however, estimate dynegy's exposure in california could give its earnings a haircut of as much as 15% this year. even so, dynegy's stock has recovered to a recent $56. ""illinova has created some volatility to dynegy's stock because of the addition of power generation to its business,"" prudential's coale said. ""but overall, it's been a great deal."" while keeping most of illinova management in place, dynegy made the company's chairman, president and ceo, charles bayless, a nonexecutive director of the combined entity. dynegy's also marketing and trading all of illinova's 3,800 megawatts of output. ""they've streamlined power generation and traded around the assets while keeping the distribution business in a sweet spot,"" said john olson, an analyst at sanders morris harris in houston. illinova, meanwhile, solved a big investor-related problem for dynegy. before the merger, only 10% of dynegy's shares were available to the public. as part of the deal, watson convinced two of dynegy's strategic partners, british gas plc and nova chemicals, to sell their combined 50% stake for approximately $542 million in cash and 3,348,888 shares of a new convertible preferred stock. it also issued 3.3 million shares after the deal closed. those moves increased dynegy's float to more than 60% of the shares outstanding, which led money managers to flood in. the company's market capitalization has since tripled to $18.3 billion. operationally, in its effort to focus on power generation, trading and marketing, dynegy has been dumping some of its mid-stream assets, such as processing plants and pipelines, particularly in the mid-continent region. the idea now is to increase dynegy's so-called merchant power capacity -- or the electricity it sells wholesale to anyone who needs it -- to 70,000 megawatts by 2004 through acquisitions, new construction and asset management agreements. as a result, watson has become what some are calling ""an acquisitions hound."" he's already acquired some facilities. on jan. 31, dynegy completed the purchase of two power plants in the hudson river valley -- the 1,200-megawatt roseton power plant in newburgh, n.y., and the 500-megawatt danskammer plant nearby -- from various area utilities for $376 million. banc of america securities llc advised dynegy on both purchases. dynegy has had trouble picking up other power plants, however. witness the deal it announced nov. 20 to acquire 1,330 megawatts worth of electricity-generating assets in nevada from reno-based sierra pacific resources for $634 million. the deal got scotched april 18 when nevada regulators -- spooked by its next-door neighbor's power crisis -- repealed the state's electricity deregulation plan and put a moratorium on all power plant sales in the state. (dynegy estimated the acquisition would have added 5 cents per share to 2001 earnings.) still, since the illinova merger, the total generating capacity built or acquired by dynegy now exceeds the total capacity added through the merger. that includes 1,160 megawatts of new natural gas-fired generation facilities in georgia, kentucky and louisiana that are expected to begin commercial operation by june -- just in time for summer. like its cross-town rival, enron corp., dynegy has also expanded via acquisitions into broadband telecommunications. (dynegy also competes with houston-based reliant energy and charlotte, n.c.-based duke energy.) both enron and dynegy see a big opportunity in broadband, given that there are few other suppliers and that managing its movement is akin to what's involved with natural gas or electricity. in august, dynegy announced it was acquiring aurora, colo.-based extant inc., a privately held developer of telecom solutions, for $188 million in cash and stock. it completed the deal in september. then in november, dynegy announced it was acquiring privately held iaxis ltd., a london-based telecom that owned and operated an 8,750-mile fiber-optic network throughout europe, for almost $200 million. dynegy completed the deal in march. dynegy is now developing a 20,000-mile fiber-optic cable network in the u.s. that it will link to iaxis' network in europe. it hopes its broadband unit, which lost $11.6 million in the first quarter, will be profitable by the second half of 2002. still, dynegy has differentiated itself as the ""anti-enron"" because, among other things, it continues to buy power plants rather than sell them. (enron, meanwhile, has been trying to dump its hard assets, such as portland general electric in portland, ore.) enron ceo jeff skilling -- a polished former mckinsey & co. consultant -- just wants to be a go-between, and not just in energy, but in broadband, pulp and paper and metals, while dynegy's watson -- a scrappy former commodities trader -- thinks he can play power generation and trading off each other. it'll be interesting to see who is right. looking back at the illinova deal dynegy inc.'s acquisition of illinova corp. has proven one of the best deals of the year. company dynegy inc. president charles l.

""this is undoubtedly positive news for bt bond holders,"" hsbc said in a research note. review & outlook (editorial) power, pricing and politics 05/03/2001 the asian wall street journal 7 (copyright (c) 2001, dow jones & company, inc.) india's electricity shortage can't be solved without a new approach. india's power problem is back on the front burner because global generating giant enron is threatening to turn off the lights at its dhabol plant and walk away from a contract with the maharashtra state electricity board. in an effort to collect $48 million owed for electricity already supplied, the american company has invoked central government guarantees and declared a political force majeure, but without much success. so technically india is facing a sovereign default, after which enron would spend years battling through the courts to get compensation for the $3 billion project. of course everyone knows that's not going to happen. after more brinksmanship from both sides, in the coming days they will have to sit down and negotiate a settlement. some of the problems with enron are unique to that particular arrangement, but in its basic outline the saga epitomizes a flawed attempt to deal with india's power problem, narrowly defined: a shortage of generating capacity. the country suffers constant blackouts due to a supply shortage of about 6%, and even more during times of peak demand. in the early 1990s, the central government sought to solve this shortfall by opening the doors to private investors like enron. but this proved to be a mistake because power distribution is controlled by the state governments -- they run it as a system of wealth redistribution rather than a business. california recently made the earth-shattering discovery that a lack of market pricing at the consumer level leads to disaster. but india's state electricity boards, or sebs, proved that long ago; they have long been bankrupt, and often default on payments to private generators. as a result, most of the big names in power have now pulled out of india. yes, the country does need to worry about generating capacity. it's estimated that in the next 12 years demand will more than double, with an additional 100,000 megawatts needed, but only half of that is likely to be built. that could increase the shortfall during peak demand to 24%, a frightening prospect. but the first order of business is to reform distribution. there is a debate now about how to give state governments the right incentives to reform their sebs. these owe almost $6 billion to central government-owned generators and mines, from whom they buy much of their power and coal. in the recently passed budget, new delhi included a provision to forgive this debt as long as the state governments commit to either privatizing their sebs or putting a floor on electricity prices. electricity meters would actually be installed to measure power usage, but subsidies would still be allowed; many customers wouldn't pay enough to cover the true cost of that power. still, this would be big progress by indian standards if it happened. many farmers currently get their power for free, and over 30% of power generated is stolen -- something the sebs euphemistically call ""transmission and distribution losses."" as a result, the electricity boards average a return on investment of negative 18%. however, new delhi is offering quite a big carrot and not much stick. after a march 3 meeting between the prime minister and state leaders, rajnath singh, the chief minister of uttar pradesh, said quite clearly that he wouldn't hike energy charges for farmers. the reason is obvious -- he faces elections next year, and free power has become an entitlement that no politician lightly takes away. chief ministers will likely sign on to new delhi's plan in order to get debt relief, but will backslide on implementation. the only thing that will make the states serious about reform is a hard budget constraint, which is the opposite of what the government is offering. one way to provide it would be to hand over the centrally owned power generators and mines to the states. they would then have to figure out how to keep the system running. if they still chose not to charge for electricity, they would have to find the money for power generation from other parts of their budgets. another reform some have suggested is to pass a national law which legalizes private power producers. some states allow companies to have their own ""captive"" power plants to maintain supply when the public grid fails. but these are typically not permitted to sell their power outside of the parent company. if larger plants that could supply several industrial firms were legalized, the states would come under greater pressure to reform. the private power suppliers could cherry-pick the best customers, those willing to pay for reliable power, leaving the state to subsidize the freeloaders. this would also have the benefit of quickly boosting the country's power supply, since captive plants already have about 10,000 megawatts of unused capacity. new delhi is still trying to reform the country's power market by fiat. this means years of political wrangling while a growing economy is strangled by a shortage of electricity. instead, the would-be reformers could let the power of the invisible hand push the state governments in the right direction. india: foreign funds plough money into indian shares. by anurag sood 05/03/2001 reuters english news service (c) reuters limited 2001. bombay, may 3 (reuters) - a stock market scandal, the high-flying software sector skidding to a slowdown, a faltering industrial growth and fears india's biggest foreign investor might pull out. these are some of the events that shook indian investors, regulators and legislators in the first four months of 2001. yet foreign funds with deep pockets seem undeterred and have pumped money into emerging asia's third biggest stock market by market capitalisation. official data show foreign institutional investors were net buyers in indian shares of $340 million in april, boosting the january-april tally to $1.98 billion - exceeding the $1.53 billion in the whole of 2000. ""there has been a higher allocation to asia this year, part of which has found its way into india,"" said singapore-based samir arora, head of asian emerging markets at alliance capital. he said these were funds deserting the united states on fears of a slowdown and losses on wall street, but afraid to get into crisis-ridden japan, and hence hunting for better returns in emerging asia. according to lipper asia ltd, a reuters global funds data company, investments by the 20 biggest fund investors in asia soared to $615.8 billion in the january-march period, up from $354.3 billion in the same quarter last year. but the country's stock market this year has been among the worst performers in the region. the bombay benchmark index is down 10.92 percent since the start of january, only ahead of indonesia. the buy list the shopping cart shows pickings this year have been widespread, from technology where fund managers say valuations were attractive after the meltdown, to the old industrial firms they feel could ride the wave of a turnaround. the indian economy, number two in developing asia by gross domestic product, is seen growing close by an average six percent - the imf estimates 5.6 percent, the asian development bank 6.2 percent and the indian central bank 6.0-6.5 percent. ajit ranade, economist at abn amro bank, says india's large domestic economy, resilient to the global slowdown, could pull more funds into the country. but a blizzard of stock market scandals which revealed share price manipulation has unnerved some foreign investors. ""weak regulation is a part of an emerging market risk, but that does not rule out caution,"" said an india strategist at a foreign brokerage. analysts say foreign fund flows are unlikely to be influenced much by events such as the enron controversy, where the u.s. energy giant is threatening to pull out of its $2.9 billion power project in the western indian state of maharashtra. enron is india's single biggest foreign direct investor. they say factors that influence foreign portfolio investments are different from the considerations that drive longer term direct investments. the indian government's decision to hike foreign funds' investment limit in indian firms to 49 percent has also added to fresh buying in indian software services firms. ""india's technology sector is still the best in the region. it has got low capital expenditure, no inventory, and increasingly their customers are outside the technology sector, in areas like banking, insurance and other industrial sectors,"" arora of alliance capital said. india: parties up the ante for probe into enron deal mahesh vijapurkar 05/03/2001 the hindu copyright (c) 2001 kasturi & sons ltd (ksl); source: world reporter (tm) - asia intelligence wire mumbai, may 2. all left-of-centre political parties, either partners in the coalition or supportive of the democratic front government, today thrashed its effort to renegotiate the power purchase agreement (ppa) with the enron -sponsored dabhol power company. the least- cost option was to initiate a judicial probe into the deal, which was replete with fraud, and seek the scrapping of the project, they said. this view was made public after the parties - peasants and workers party, the cpi(m), the janata dal (secular), the samajwadi party and others - met here and decided to press the demand at a meeting of the coordination committee of all parties, including the congress and the nationalist congress party, on may 8. its scheduled meeting for today was put off as the chief minister, mr. vilasrao deshmukh, was away electioneering in the south. these parties, worried about the huge, unpayable dpc bills, had been demanding a probe under the inquiries commissions act but today upped the ante, saying ""we are convinced of fraud"" in the agreement with dpc. ""the renegotiation,"" mr. n. d. patil, who leads the left grouping and heads the all-party coordination panel said, ""is not what we want... we don't want it at all."" he and mr. prabhakar sanzgiri, cpi(m), said ""we no longer suspect it. we are convinced"" of malfeasance. along with mr. pradhyumna kaul of the anti-enron campaign, they told a press conference that the moment fraud was proved, the ppa could be annulled and ""the huge liquidation penalties can be avoided."" the demand was to scrap the 1,444 mw phase ii, ""take over"" the 740 mw phase i and initiate a probe. ""the godbole committee (report) has provided enough grounds,"" though phase i ""was a reality and phase ii only an eventuality."" even a small criminal probe would put any arbitration decision, sought by the dpc, ""on hold."" the lobby pressing for scrapping the ppa said an fir against the maharashtra state electricity board, under the provisions of section 10 of the electricity supply act, would suffice as there were enough grounds to prove that the entity or persons concerned had 'played games' at one time or the other. it cited bloated projections of energy demand in maharashtra, provided by the mseb to dpc, to justify the work on the phase ii which is now under stress following lenders' reluctance to provide funds till the issue is sorted out. when asked why mr. deshmukh preferred renegotiation and trimming of power tariff to a probe, mr. patil said ""that is his view."" for their part, the parties ""would press for change at the meeting on may 8... we are not witch hunting. there have been fraudulent acts and we want them probed."" india: handle enron cautiously: deshmukh our special correspondent 05/03/2001 the hindu copyright (c) 2001 kasturi & sons ltd (ksl); source: world reporter (tm) - asia intelligence wire thiruvananthapuram, may 2. the maharashtra chief minister, mr. vilasrao deshmukh, today advised the state to handle the enron issue cautiously and refrain from committing the mistakes made by his state. addressing a press conference here today, mr. deshmukh said the maharashtra government was treading carefully on the enron issue and it hoped to renegotiate the power tariff with the u.s. company. mr. deshmukh's observations assume significance in the context of the running controversy regarding the kannur power project, which had been denied permission by the ldf government. mr. deshmukh said that enron had written to the maharashtra state electricity board that it was ready to renegotiate the power tariff provided the government of india made a formal request. he said the renegotiation would start as soon as the union government handed over the formal letter asking for a renegotiation. mr. deshmukh pointed out that the basic issue in enron's dabhol project was related to the power tariff. the foreign exchange rate was fixed at rs. 32 a dollar at the start of the project. but now, it had gone up to rs. 47 a dollar, thereby pushing the cost of power up. he indicated that the renegotiations would focus on this aspect as well. the maharashtra government had proposed renegotiation on the basis of the godbole commission recommendation. he was confident that the enron would agree to renegotiate the tariff in the interests of the maharashtra government and its own interests. in reply to a question, mr. deshmukh said the enron project had been a major drain on his state's finances, but it had overcome all problems by handling them very carefully. he said the maharashtra government would extend all support to the udf if it were to come to power to process the various parameters relating to the kannur project so that it did not commit the same kind of mistake as maharashtra did. he, however, made it clear that his government welcomed foreign direct investments but not at the cost of the state's interests. mr. deshmukh attacked the centre for not using the various options available under the wto agreement to come out with a balanced import-export policy. asked for his comments on mr. sharad pawar's statement that the ncp was considering joining the people's front, mr. deshmukh made it very clear that his party's alliance with the ncp was confined to maharashtra alone. 'the alliance with the ncp is a post- election affair as part of the attempts to unite all secular forces. the congress had fought the ncp and several other parties which are now part of the congress-led government. but the alliance had been formed in order to keep the bjp-shiv sena combine out,' he said. asked how his party could accept the ncp which had an alliance going with the bjp in meghalaya, mr. deshmukh said the congress- ncp ties were confined to maharashtra. 'if the ncp creates any problems in maharashtra, the alliance would end,' he said. mr. deshmukh attacked the cpi(m)-led ldf for its five- year misrule which had left the state virtually bankrupt. 'the credibility of the ldf is so low that the people would not vote for it.' the cpi(m)-led left parties would be defeated in kerala and west bengal, he added. ? india: promoters holding parleys on future course of action 05/03/2001 business line (the hindu) copyright (c) 2001 kasturi & sons ltd (ksl); source: world reporter (tm) - asia intelligence wire new delhi, may 2. the shipping corporation of india, mitsui o.s.k. lines, atlantic commercial inc (an enron affiliate) are holding parleys at houston, us, the headquarters of enron inc,to decide the future course of action on its lng shipping deal for the dabhol power company (dpc). the controversy surrounding the enron-promoted dpc and the apprehension raised by the lenders to the lng shipping project has made the three shipping promoters of greenfield shipping company take stock of the situation. ""a final view on the lng shipping deal will depend on what enron decides on the power project per se and not just the second phase of the project which is being planned as a lng- driven plant. even the first phase is expected to switch-over to lng in a couple of years"", sources tracking the sequence of events told business line. the promoters have already paid 70 per cent of the vessel building cost to mitsubishi heavy industries, japan, where the 135,000-cubic metre capacity vessel is being constructed at a total cost of $ 224 million. according to the delivery schedule, the lng vessel named laxmi is expected to be completed and delivered by october end this year. a consortium of 11 global banks led by anz investment bank has taken a high exposure on the lng shipping project. the greenfield shipping company had struck a 10-year loan with the lenders worth $ 165 million at 325 basis points over libor. sci has a 20 per cent equity stake in the project while mitsui o.s.k.lines hold 60 per cent and atlantic commercial inc. 20 per cent. the lng shipping deal for dabhol was the first lng shipping contract in the country involving an indian shipping line. greenfield shipping company had entered into a time- charter agreement with dpc to transport lng from west asia to its power plant in maharashtra at a time-charter hire rate of $ 98,600 per day for 20 years. unlike in the case of other ships, lng ships do not have a secondary market since these are acquired against specific long-term contracts. in case of any eventuality, greenfield shipping company would find it difficult to divert the vessel elsewhere as globally spot trade in lng is almost nil. fortunately for the greenfield shipping company, the prices for new lng buildings have started ""firming up"" after travelling through a downward trend till recently. mitsui o.s.k.lines-nykk line-kkk line-sci consortium which recently bagged the shipping contract from petronet lng ltd also, has placed an order with daewoo shipbuilding yard to construct two lng tankers of 1,38,000 cubic metre capacity each at $ 185 million per vessel. this phase witnessed lng building prices go down substantially, but has since started picking up. our bureau india: bank of america to invest $50 m more in india 05/03/2001 business line (the hindu) copyright (c) 2001 kasturi & sons ltd (ksl); source: world reporter (tm) - asia intelligence wire mumbai, may 2. bank of america plans to invest around $50 million (rs 235 crore) to expand its business in india in the next two years, according to mr viswavir ahuja, who took over as country manager of the bank in india from may 1. ""we have already obtained fipb and rbi clearance and the first installment of $10.5 million will be brought in shortly,"" mr ahuja said. the bank is setting up a 100 per cent subsidiary - banc of america securities pvt ltd - for undertaking primary dealership in government securities and dealing in other debt products. in a chat with presspersons here on wednesday, mr ahuja said in terms of strategy, ""the bank intends to favour judicious balance sheet usage while increasing trading and distribution and advisory capabilities."" bank of america, which exited from retail banking a couple of years ago, is now focussing on the wholesale segment. it would open a new branch in bangalore, the fifth in the country, in the third-quarter. the bank has an exposure in power, telecom and other segments of the infrastructure sector. bank of america is among the foreign lenders to the enron's dhabol power project. our bureau india: renegotiation with enron likely, says deshmukh 05/03/2001 business line (the hindu) copyright (c) 2001 kasturi & sons ltd (ksl); source: world reporter (tm) - asia intelligence wire thiruvananthapuram, may 2. though it continues to be a major embarrassment and a heavy draw on its finances, the enron issue seems to have armed the maharashtra government with enough ""expertise"" to advise on similar projects elsewhere in the country. this was one of the upshots at the news conference by the maharashtra chief minister, mr vilasrao deshmukh, who is on an election campaign on behalf of the united democratic front (udf), here on wednesday. in the course of his interaction with the newspersons, he said his government would extend all support to udf, if it came to power, to process the various parameters relating to the kannur project so that it did not commit the same kind of mistakes such as maharashtra. he, however, made it clear that his government would welcome foreign direct investments, but not at the cost of the state's interests. mr deshmukh said the maharashtra government was hopeful of renegotiating the issue of tariff for the power from dhabol project with enron. he said enron had written to the maharashtra state electricity board (mseb) that it was ready to renegotiate power tariff provided the union government made a formal request. the renegotiation would begin as soon as the union government handed over the formal letter in this regard, he added. the chief minister said the basic issue was related to the power tariff. the foreign exchange component was fixed at rs 32 per dollar at the start of the project, which had now gone up to rs 47 per dollar thereby pushing up the cost of power. he indicated that the renegotiations would focus on this aspect as well. he explained that the maharashtra government had proposed renegotiation on the basis of godbole commission recommendation. he was confident that enron would agree to renegotiate the tariff in its own interest as well as that of the state government. our bureau let enron exit aditya chatterjee & pooja kothari 05/03/2001 the times of india copyright (c) 2001 the times of india; source: world reporter (tm) for years, enron tried to woo indian policy-makers, who couldn't seem to decide whether the dabhol project was a good idea or not. today, the boot is on the other foot, and it seems to be pinching. enron's management is keen to stop investing in huge, capital-intensive plants around the world. in keeping with this strategy -and no doubt exhausted by its ceaseless crisis management in india - enron is mulling a pullout. but both the centre and maharashtra government want to renegotiate the power purchase agreement and have entrusted this responsibility to the madhav godbole panel. is enron really as indispensable as the authorities seem to think it is? financially, no. indeed, if the only way to continue the project is on the present terms, then it makes better sense to simply scrap it. after all, it's better to amputate a gangrenous limb than to let the problem spread further. a little arithmetic will make this amply clear. if the dabhol power company (dpc) does scrap its agreement with the maharashtra state electricity board, the centre will have to cough up a sum of rs 2,910 crore - a penalty amount of rs 1,500 crore for one year's electricity bill, and $300 million as termination fees (which works out to rs 1,410 crore at an assumed exchange rate of 47 rupees to one dollar). this is a one-time payment, and the figure of rs 2,910 crore is corroborated by a recent statement by union power secretary a k basu. now, if india were to continue with the present arrangement, it would end up paying at least rs 1,500 crore per year for the next 10 years to dpc. on the other hand, what would happen if the project were scrapped? well, very simplistically, india would save rs 15,000 crore (rs 1,500 crore multiplied by 10 years). but things aren't quite that simple, because that money could earn interest, while inflation would mean that rs 15,000 crore after 10 years would not have the same value it would have today. to get around this problem, financial experts use a concept called net present value, which discounts future earning streams as well as inflation, to evaluate the attractiveness of a project. if we use a discount rate of 10 per cent, then the value of the amount india would save by scrapping the dabhol project works out to rs 9,217 crore, over three times the amount india would have to pay today if the agreement with dpc is terminated. indian financial institutions (fis) and banks which have lent money to dpc are actively lobbying to prevent such an eventuality. but how badly would they be hit? well, fis led by industrial development bank of india have provided loans of $95 million and $333 million in two phases. this brings their total exposure to $428 million (rs 2,012 crore at an exchange rate of 47/$). besides, state bank of india also underwrote the maximum portion of a $557 million cross-border loan, and has an exposure of about $175 million (rs 823 crore). thus, the cumulative exposure of indian banks and fis in dpc works out to around rs 2,835 crore. however, since only 80 per cent of this amount has been disbursed so far, the net exposure of indian lenders amounts to rs 2,268 crore. since the indian lenders are not covered by any counter-guarantee, their bottomline would be hit if enron backs out. the government, being a majority stakeholder in most of these institutions, would also be affected. but even if all these loans are taken into account and added to the one-time payment of rs 2,910 crore, the total cost to the government would be rs 5,178 crore - still lower than rs 9,217 crore. thus, the termination option will prove less costly for the nation than proceeding on the present terms. what will happen to the assets and the plant, did we hear you ask? well, the government can sell it to private players and re-negotiate the cost factor with them - this time hopefully after doing a cost-benefit analysis! a sale of assets would also lessen the load on the government. who knows, the government may actually manage to sell the ownership of dpc at a premium to another private sector player! of course, fears have been raised that cancelling the project might cost us foreign direct investment since enron is the biggest investor in india so far. after all, brazil raised $31 billion and china $49 billion last year in comparison with india's measly $4 billion. but there's another way of looking at the problem - what does india really have to lose? in short, it's a case of losing what you don't even have in the first place. many developing nations which were pushed into signing expensive power projects by multinationals have successfully re-negotiated their contracts with no serious financial consequences. many nations simply did not have the money to pay for the inflated bills, some refused to pay even after losing international arbitration awards, while others like costa rica declared that the 15 contracts signed with independent power producers (like enron) have no legal status or are bad in law. in july 1999, the hungarian parliament declared that a ppa signed with multinational rwe was unconstitutional and void. in august 2000, the croatian government tore up a ppa signed between enron and a previous government. the contract was considered to be unaffordable, and was allegedly signed in suspicious circumstances. enron subsequently abandoned the original agreement. in september 2000, the philippines took a decision to not renew financially crippling contracts with ipps. controversy has accompanied the dabhol project from the start. in august 1994, the finance ministry had written to the power ministry that the size of ""the potential liability for a 1,000 megawatt plant was around rs 3,000 crore per year"". the department of economic affairs had also warned that the ""...risk of counter-guarantees being invoked was not unreal, given that state electricity bills had been defaulting in payments"". caution was thrown to the winds then. the least india can do now is ask for a re-negotiation. but does the indian government have the courage to go eyeball-to-eyeball with enron and not blink first? * scrapping the power purchase agreement involves a one-time payment of rs 2,910 crore * however, india would save over rs 9,000 crore by doing so * there would be a net saving even after writing off fi loans to dabhol power company idbi: whose life is it, anyway? tamal bandyopadhyay 05/03/2001 business standard 14 copyright (c) business standard on april 30 a terse one-line announcement by the finance ministry gave the acting chairman and managing director of industrial development bank of india (idbi), s k chakrabarti, a three-month extension. the government was generous enough not to keep the cmd as well as the institution waiting till late evening which it normally does for the fax message from north block. but the acting idbi chief may be asked to step down even in three weeks if the government is able to identify his successor. he has been reappointed for a period of three months or till a regular cmd takes charge ""whichever is earlier"". could there have been a better way to insult the country's largest financial institution (and its chief)? first, the government planned to merge the industrial finance corporation of india (ifci) _which is on the brink of collapse under the burden of ballooning non-performing assets with idbi to make them sink together. unable to push through the proposal in the face of stiff resistance put up by idbi, the government now appears to be keen on leading the country's premier financial institution to its grave alone. this, not by giving an extension to the existing acting chief but by failing to identify his successor and thereby continuing the uncertainty at the top. nothing can move in an organisation when the ceo himself does not know how long he will survive. india's financial institutions have been repositioning themselves by going short-term both on the assets as well as the liabilities sides. but for that transformation to take effect, they need leaders with a long-term tenure at the helm. to understand this, let's look at what's happening at icici, another financial institution in the country that is breathing down on idbi's neck and threatening to overtake it. k v kamath, ceo and managing director of icici, got a second five-year term seven days ahead of the expiry of his first term on march 30. once his second term is complete, kamath will have ended up running the show at icici for a decade. icici does not only give its chief a long term to steer the ship but also grooms talent to take over the institution in due course. kamath was groomed by his predecessor n vaghul. in turn, he is now grooming nachiket mor to succeed him. mor, a former senior general manager of icici, has recently been shifted to icici bank as an executive director in charge of wholesale banking. he is likely to be made the managing director of the bank when the present incumbent h n sinor steps down next year. eventually, he will take over the mantle from kamath in 2006 by which time his stint at the bank will have given him enough operational experience in addition to his treasury management and other skills. given the circumstances, idbi is fighting a losing battle. it will not be surprising if it goes the ifci way with an uncertain leadership unable to steer a demoralised, overstaffed ship becalmed by the apathetic bureaucracy of the north block. this is despite its tremendous brand value in project financing and widespread corporate relationships. carved out of the reserve bank of india by an act of parliament in 1976, idbi has business relations with virtually every corporate house in india. but that is not helping it tide over the crisis, because the key to any financial intermediary's success at this juncture is how it handles its resources _both currency as well as human. in an ideal situation, the cost of funds should be lower while the cost of human resources should be market-driven. in idbi's case, it is the reverse: its cost of funds is on the higher side in the absence of aggressive treasury operations and it is not allowed to pay market-driven salary to its employees. the net result? there has been an exodus of talent from idbi and the institution is struggling to stay afloat just when recession has prompted corporations to cut back on their borrowings. idbi's sanctions and disbursements have been falling and non-performing assets increasing. it is sitting on piles of cash but finding deployment avenues hard to come by. two former chiefs of idbi s h khan and g p gupta spent a large chunk of their tenure and energy pleading with the finance ministry to delink idbi's salary structure from that of the reserve bank of india, but without success. small wonder that chakrabarti, who became acting chairman on february 1 for a three-month term, has singled out the low morale of the staff as his prime concern. he wants to address this on a war footing. the centre has now successfully demoralised him by offering him another uncertain term. former finance minister manmohan singh accepted khan's argument on market-driven package (he reportedly wanted a pay scale for his employees that was higher icici's) but could not do anything about it. p chidambaram repeated singh's failure on this front and yashwant sinha too thinks the proposal is not worth considering because it will have a ripple effect in the industry. for instance, rbi employees will immediately demand their pound of flesh. the finance ministry refuses to see the point that the country's central bank is not a commercial organisation and does not have to compete with icici. when three successive finance ministers failed to address idbi's, problems, the institution went for soft options. it ended up appointing three consultants for restructuring in six years! first, booz, allen & hamilton (in 1997), followed by m b athreya (in 1999) and finally boston consulting group (2001). the third consultant, bcg, is yet to submit its report. while booz, allen & hamilton charted out the roadmap for diversification and suggested that the institution spread its wings overseas and tap new business opportunities, the athreya panel said it must convert itself into a bank and the government's stake should come down without delay. over the last few years, the institution has been planning its conversion into a bank and blaming the economy for its indifferent performance even as icici has been going full steam with new initiatives. icici bank is also exploiting synergies with its parent to the hilt while idbi bank seems to be embarrassed about ackowledging its pedigree. it's not that everything is great at icici. over the past few years, the institution has lost some senior executives: i-sec managing director kishore chaukar left to join the tata group, icici senior general managers anando mukherji joined enron and n j subaiah took charge at centurion bank (which he subsequently left). the industry suspects the quality of icici's assets and is not comfortable with the scorching pace of growth. even the well-paid icici executive cadres find the pace of work is too much to handle and complain of fatigue. in private, they hate the mad rush for excellence. and yet there is a method in icici's madness. it has trimmed the flab with two successive voluntary retirement schemes, branched out into consumer loans in a big way and transformed treasury operations into an art. the finance ministry would do well to explore the possibility of divesting the government's stake in idbi to icici. instead of pumping in rs 300 crore as recapitalisation funds into ifci it can simply let it die and sell its assets to other banks and financial institutions. idbi's bulk and the brand name in project financing would combine well with icici's growing retail presence and unbridled aggression. the combination would be formidable enough to give the state bank of india a run for its money. of course, a whole lot of issues need to settled before the process takes off like trimming the flab in idbi and delinking it from the rbi pay structure et al. idbi merging with icici may sound like an absurd dream but it is certainly a better option than merging ifci with idbi. if reliance is willing to bid for state-run oil majors hpcl and bpcl, what's the harm in wooing icici to take over idbi?

""this year's financial results have been impacted by the outage at the hunter power station in utah at a time of exceptional volatility in the western u.s. power markets, and by the expected reductions in revenues resulting from the u.k. regulatory reviews"" chief executive ian russell said. with hunter back on track, scottish power is looking to grow the business of pacificorp, hunter's owner, and plans to add some 1,000 megawatts of new capacity by the end of the year, russell said. he didn't rule out plans for further acquisitions in the u.s., but declined to confirm or deny reports earlier this week that the u.k. utility is considering bidding for enron corp.'s (ene) oregon-based subsidiary, portland general.

""our strategy is very definitely to expand in the uk, both in generation and supply,"" russell said. ""we are very focused on expanding the value that we get from that integrated chain. at the moment, we are doing well on the organic side and would seek opportunities in acquisitive supply if we thought we could do so profitably."" the company's regulated infrastructure business was also hit by strict revenue limits, cutting total operating profit in its power systems and water business to gbp545.5 million from gbp647.7 million a year earlier. the company's 90% debt levels are likely to increase pressure on scottish power to sell its southern water unit in order to fund its expansion strategy, lehman brothers analyst gareth lewis-davies said. speaking to journalists on a conference call russell reiterated that the company is still considering all options for the water company, although he confirmed that scottish power had received ""a number of offers"" from potential buyers.

(recasts with exec comment on thus, updates shares, adds fund manager comment) by andrew callus london, may 3 (reuters) - scottish power plc announced a restructuring on thursday reflecting plans for expansion in the united states and a tighter power sector focus in its british home market. britain's largest power utility was reporting a decline in pre-tax profits before exceptional items and goodwill for the year to march 2001 to 628 million pounds ($892 million) from 736 million a year ago. but its shares rose 2.8 percent to 453-3/4 pence on some good news on costs and power generation in the united states, where plant breakdown and high prices have hit earnings and investor sentiment. hunter, a power station in utah, came back on line on thursday after a 160-day breakdown that cost $1 million a day and helped deliver 10-percent sector share-price underperformance over the period. new u.s. plants are also coming on stream. the profit figure was in line with analysts' forecasts, hit by uk regulation, the hunter outage and high u.s. power prices. ""they are keeping those costs down in the united states,"" said one sector analyst. ""there were stories out there they were going to be worse than they have been saying, and it wasn't."" the breakdown at hunter, part of the uk group's 1999 pacificorp acquisition, was unusually costly because power had to be bought in to replace the 430 megawatts (mw) of lost capacity while power prices in the region were very high. even with hunter back up, pacificorp has more customer demand than plant to supply it, so high wholesale prices will continue to be a problem. the new structure unveiled on thursday consists of a u.s. division including pacificorp's regulated and unregulated businesses, a uk division covering generation and energy supply in britain, and a third, infrastructure division which includes power systems and southern water in the uk, and create a link between u.s. and uk infrastructure businesses. new u.s. plant chief executive ian russell told reporters by telephone the hunter power plant was now reconnected to the grid and would reach full operating capacity ""within a few days"". he was also upbeat about prospects for expanding generation in the united states, where scottish power aims to have new plants with an extra 1,000 mw, or 10 percent of current capacity, on stream this year. he announced that the first of these, a 100 mw plant at gadsby in salt lake city, utah, began producing on thursday as well. another, 400 mw, plant being built in oregon ""will be onstream in a month or so"", russell said. portland scottish power confirmed it was still looking at the possible sale or refinancing of its southern water business in britain, and russell said there had been ""a number of expressions of interest"" for the business, worth about 1.8 billion pounds ""but we are some way away from a conclusion"". he also said he was still looking for a further u.s. acquisition, but would not confirm reports he was in talks with u.s. power trading group enron corp about buying its portland, oregon power arm. ""when we acquired pacificorp we said it was a platform for further growth... obviously portland is right in our own back yard,"" he said. ""frankly we're still very busy with pacificorp and for the time being that's what we are focused on."" investors have been concerned about the group's dealmaking plans given the weak market for uk water infrastructure assets and volatility in the u.s. market. ""there is still a bit of deal risk there amidst worries they may sell southern water too cheaply,"" said one fund manager who is underweight in the stock. ceo russell said the three-way restructuring would help the group ""sharpen our focus on improving shareholder value"" and ""capture opportunities in the (u.s.) western power markets"". pacificorp contributed operating profit of 351 million pounds, after the impact of the hunter outage, compared to 152 million pounds four month contribution a year earlier. the group's 140 million pounds-a-year three-year uk cost saving plan was on track at the end of its first year, russell said. finance director david nish expressed continuing support for thus, its spun-off startup telecoms business in which it still holds just over 50 percent. thus is still lossmaking and has been struck by general investor disaffection with telecoms companies and concerns about how it would secure future funding. but nish said scottish power had ""no plans to do anything other than be supportive"" of the company. (additional reporting by sonya dowsett). distractions interfere with key growth questions financial times, may 3, 2001 by andrew taylor in london cynics claim that scottish power's legal action launched this week, to rewrite a long term electricity supply contract, was more about distracting attention from the group's poor results than a realistic bid to cut costs. this judgment is a little harsh. scottish power would benefit considerably if it could renegotiate the deal that requires it to buy three-quarters of scotland's nuclear output. the british energy contract is worth o1bn ($1.44bn) in the next four years. shareholders could do with some distraction. scottish power, by its own admission, has had a tough year, which will be confirmed today when it publishes results for 2000. ian russell, who took over as chief executive in march, may even indulge in the new boy's practice of including the cost of further forseeable bad news in the figures, making any subsequent improvement appear greater. his biggest problem will be to convince the city that he is capable of developing an effective strategy to change the group's direction, now it has abandoned plans to become a multi-utility. the group no longer believes adequate returns can be earned from developing a growing range of products to sell to its more than 5m customers. the investment required to develop national brands, win new customers and retain old ones is too high in an increasingly competitive uk retail sector, it says. mr russell, who as scottish power's former finance director was closely associated with the previous policy, has already withdrawn from joint ventures with royal bank of scotland to provide financial services and with thus to provide telecommunications. the group is also discussing the future of southern water, its south of england utility, which enel, the italian state-controlled energy group, is interested in buying. cross-selling electricity and gas to southern water customers, let alone other products, has been disappointing, it admits. the group plans to concentrate on developing its energy interests in the uk and us. but these also have their difficulties. some of the biggest problems involve pacificorp, bought 18 months ago in a deal worth about o7bn, including debt. the price is looking more expensive, following big rises in us electricity wholesale prices. pacificorp has not been as badly affected as some us electricity groups. but it has faced problems because of a power station breakdown in utah that forced it to buy higher priced electricity from other generators to meet customer demand. the failure of a 430mw generating unit at its hunter power plant in november has cost the group $1m (o600m) a day since. one piece of good news for shareholders today will be the timing of its return to service this month. another positive note is that pacificorp is negotiating higher retail prices with us state regulators to offset increased generation charges. it also has about 1,000mw of its own new power plant due to start production this year. in the uk, the group is facing increased competition for retail electricity and gas sales, particularly in the household market. it has also had to absorb big price cuts imposed on its power distribution side by ofgem, the industry regulator. the shares, which fell 1p on wednesday to 441-1/2p - have fallen by more than 35 per cent against the ftse all share index since december 1998 when the pacificorp offer was announced. so where does the group go from here? it made its reputation in the 1990s as a shrewd acquirer of uk utilities - southern water for o1.6bn and manweb, the north-west of england electricity supplier, for o1.1bn. effective cost cutting increased value, particularly at manweb. the group was also one of the first electricity companies to string telecommunication lines along its electricity pylons. the sale of a 49.9 per cent stake in thus, which operates the telecoms network, raised o1bn in 1999. financing further uk and us acquisitions will be challenging. thus shares have fallen from 844-1/2p a year ago to 61p on wednesday night. scottish power has net debt of some o5bn with interest thinly covered three times by earnings before tax and interest. it has been talking with enron about buying portland general, its oregon-based electricity utility. the group might need to sell southern to cover the purchase price of about $3bn, including debt. buying in the uk may be even harder. scottish power has been outbid recently for regional electricity suppliers by the deeper pockets of large continental european utilities. what scottish power's shareholders will want to know is where growth will come from and how the group will pay for it. usa: update 2-calpine, kinder morgan plan n.m.-calif. natgas line. 05/02/2001 reuters english news service (c) reuters limited 2001. houston, may 2 (reuters) - calpine corp. and kinder morgan energy partners, l.p., said on wednesday they plan to build a new natural gas pipeline from new mexico's san juan basin to california to help meet california's growing energy demand. the companies said the sonoran line would be developed in two phases, with 400 million cubic feet of gas a day (mmcfd) already contracted by calpine for the first phase of the planned 1,160-mile line. the first phase, slated for completion in the summer of 2003 pending regulatory approval, involves building a 36-inch diameter line from san juan county, n.m., to southern california with a transport capacity of 750 mmcfd to 1 billion cubic feet a day (bcfd). phase two would extend the line to northern california and could carry up to 1.5 bcfd. calpine has contracted for 500 mmcfd of gas for the second phase of the pipeline. an open season seeking a 20 year minimum commitment will be held this month for phase one of the pipeline, during which shippers will place bids for capacity on the line. no precise day was given for when this open season will begin. another bidding process will take place for phase two, but no terms or exact dates were provided for the second open season. calpine, based in san jose, calif., and houston-based kinder morgan energy partners did not disclose how much the project would likely cost. in the past two months, several pipeline operators, including el paso corp. enron corp. unit transwestern, sempra energy unit southern california gas co., williams cos inc.'s kern river transmission, pg&e corp.'s national energy group, and questar corp. have announced plans to expand existing gas lines that feed california. california, fighting a severe power shortage that already triggered four days of blackouts this year, has over the past two years approved building 13 major gas-fired power plants with a combined generating capacity of more than 8,900 megawatts. nine power plants totalling more than 6,000 megawatts are currently under construction. usa: enron says vice chairman clifford baxter resigns 05/02/2001 reuters english news service (c) reuters limited 2001. houston, may 2 (reuters) - u.s. energy giant enron corp. said on wednesday that its vice chairman j. clifford baxter is resigning after 10 years with the company. enron said in a statement that baxter, who joined the company in 1991, is resigning to spend additional time with his family. baxter will continue to work as a consultant with the firm. he was chairman and chief executive officer of enron north america before becoming vice chairman in october last year. enron shares were down $1.81 trading at $60.60 during late afternoon. ?

""over the past 10 years, cliff has made a tremendous contribution to enron's evolution, particularly as a member of the team that built enron's wholesale business,"" said jeff skilling, enron president and ceo. ""his creativity, intelligence, sense of humor and straightforward manner have been assets to the company throughout his career. while we will miss him, we are happy that his primary reason for resigning is to spend additional time with his family, and we wish him the very best."" baxter, who will continue working for the company as a consultant, joined enron in 1991 and was chairman and ceo of enron north america prior to being named chief strategy officer for enron corp. in june 2000 and vice chairman in october 2000. enron is one of the world's leading electricity, natural gas and communications companies. the company, with revenues of $101 billion in 2000, markets electricity and natural gas, delivers physical commodities and financial and risk management services to customers around the world, and has developed an intelligent network platform to facilitate online business. fortune magazine has named enron ""america's most innovative company"" for six consecutive years. enron's internet address is www.enron.com. the stock is traded under the ticker symbol ""ene"". contact: mark palmer of enron corp., . make your opinion count - click here /contact: mark palmer of enron corp., / 15:40 edt ? local chris coursey pardon me while i scream in the dark chris coursey 05/02/2001 the press democrat santa rosa, ca city b1 (copyright 2001) i'm no economist, and i'm certainly not an expert on utilities. but i've got two eyes and a nose, and i can see that something stinks. i refer, of course, to california's energy market, or -- as the power generators call it -- ""who wants to be a multi-billionaire?"" it's becoming clear that this game is fixed. regis is giving all of the $100 questions -- ""what color is the sky?"" -- to contestants like enron and reliant, pg&e and southern california edison. meanwhile, we consumers are hit with ""how many kwh did the bpa generate in the month of may 1973? sorry, you're out of lifelines."" how are consumers supposed to compete in this game? even our legislators, who belong to the same party as gov. gray ""the negotiator"" davis, don't know what's going on.

'we hope that this new proposal would give further impetus to indian bottoms,' says shipping secretary michael pinto. 'we will do all we can to get approval from the committee of secretaries and the cabinet.' since some of the shipping contracts have already been finalised, this proposal would only be made applicable to future contracts. however, shipping experts are extremely doubtful whether the proposal can be implemented. the leading indian shipping companies have neither the funds nor the expertise of carrying lng, and would need the assistance of foreign companies to make the ventures a success. 'a foreign lng carrier is not going to settle for a minority stake unless the indian shipper is able to put up his share of the equity, which would be quite a handful,' says sudhir j mulji, executive vice-chairman of great eastern shipping company and current president of the indian national shipowners' association. 'the proposal really does not seem to be feasible.' for the moment, just two major contracts have been signed, both involving the state-owned shipping corporation of india (sci). the first one involves sci, american power major enron and mitsui of japan, for the carriage of 2.5m tonnes of lng per annum for enron's 2,184 mw mega power project at dabhol, near ratnagiri in southern maharashtra. sci had entered into this memorandum of understanding with mol (formerly mitsui osk lines) and atlantic commercial finance, which is an enron affiliate. however, it is only a 20% partner in the consortium, with enron holding a 60% stake and mitsui osk the balance 20%. the gas will be ferried by the lng lakshmi, brand-new 130,000 cu m capacity vessel being constructed in japan at the mitsui shipyard. the contract is valid for 25 years from the date of starting. however, the consortium is registered in the cayman islands, which is a tax haven, and the lng vessel will carry the flag of malta. sci has also secured the contract for carrying 5m tonnes per annum of lng for the government-owned pipeline company petronet lng. the gas is to be ferried from rasgas of qatar to the company's upcoming lng terminal at dahej, in gujarat. a similar petronet terminal, but half the size of dahej, is coming up in kochi, kerala state. the transportation contract for this is to be decided later. two other major indian shipowners, who have taken a step towards lng transportation are great eastern shipping and essar shipping. the former has formed a consortium with indian oil corporation and exmar, while essar has joined hands with malaysia international shipping corporation (misc) to form a 50:50 joint venture dedicated to gas transportation. the dollars 2.3bn misc, the national shipping line of malaysia, is one of the world's leading owners and operators of lng tankers. as a listed company on the kuala lumpur stock exchange, misc has the state-owned petroleum and oil giant petronas (a fortune 500 company) as its largest shareholder, with a stake of 62%. 'our memorandum of understanding has both companies holding an equal equity share in the joint venture,' said essar shipping's chief executive, sanjay mehta. 'however, at a later date we may both dilute our stakes equally in favour of a third strategic partner, and continue to hold equal equity. 'the final debt-equity ratio for the acquisition of the lng vessels will be decided by the management of the joint venture.' shipping secretary mr pinto feels that there are many opportunities for indian companies, but is insistent that the tonnage be registered in india, so that ancillary business activities in the sector are spurred. 'we will try and secure tax benefits for the shipowners concerned, since they badly need to gain the experience, management and manpower training in a niche segment,' he said. 'it would also help in indian fleet expansion, since tonnage has remained virtually stagnant for the last five years.'michael pin ? business scottishpower reportedly trying to purchase pge gail kinsey hill of the oregonian staff 05/02/2001 portland oregonian sunrise c03 (copyright (c) the oregonian 2001) summary: under such a deal, 70 percent of oregon's electricity users would be served by one entity scottishpower may be pursuing enron corp.'s portland general electric. pge's pending sale to nevada's sierra pacific resources officially fell apart thursday, and scottishpower reportedly has held talks with enron about buying pge, oregon's largest utility, for $3 billion. scottishpower owns portland-based pacificorp, bought in 1999 for $10.9 billion, and has said it would like to increase its u.s. holdings. a purchase of pge would bring together oregon's largest investor-owned utilities and create a powerhouse entity serving more than 70 percent of state users. pacificorp also serves customers in washington, idaho, utah, wyoming and california, for total of 1.5 million residential and business customers. pge serves 728,000 customers, primarily in the populous northern willamette valley. speculation about the potential hookup with pge surfaced during the weekend in britain's observer newspaper. in the article, an unidentified source described the merger as ""an obvious one and, yes, there have been discussions."" on tuesday, officials from the various utilities and parent companies would neither confirm nor deny that talks, formal or informal, had taken place. ""it's a vigorous 'no comment' on the rumors,"" said mark palmer, houston-based enron spokesman. ""we don't comment on market speculation,"" said rachel sherrard, a spokeswoman for pacificorp. the speculation, whether of substance or whimsy, has drawn the attention of state regulators and consumer advocacy groups. ""i think it would get a great deal of scrutiny, and i think there would be some serious concerns,"" said ron eachus, head of the oregon public utility commission. the puc must approve utility mergers. the agency hasn't received any notice that talks are occurring, eachus said. bob jenks, executive director of the citizens' utility board, said his organization, which represents customers of investor-owned utilities, likely would oppose a pge-pacificorp merger. ""we're not pleased"" by the idea, he said. the citizens' utility board has become increasingly critical of pacificorp's handling of the west's electricity crisis, which has forced the utility into the expensive wholesale power market. the board is fighting pacificorp's efforts to raise rates by 24 percent. in november 1999, sierra pacific announced plans to buy pge for $3.1 billion. but the energy shortage slammed into sierra pacific's finances and spoiled the bid. sci ups profile with petronet deal 05/02/2001 lloyd's list international 14 copyright (c) 2001 lloyds list; source: world reporter (tm) with the shipping corporation of india taking a major stake in the petronet lng, india's maritime industries a high profile, shirish nadkarni on the final thursday of march, there was a celebration in nedelhi, involving the four members of the consortium that had bagged the dollars 400m liquefied natural gas transportation contract of petronet lng. 'it is the japanese custom to celebrate an event like this; and only the consortium members and their officials were invited to the function,' says km joseph, director, bulk carriers and tankers, with the shipping corporation of india (sci), which has a 34.21% equity stake in the winning partnership. the other members of the consortium are japan's mol (formerly mitsui osk lines), nyk line and k line; and the contract involves ferrying 5m tonnes per annum of lng from the middle east to petronet lng's terminal at dahej, in gujarat. two lng carriers will be involved in the deal, each capable of carrying 138,000 cu m of gas, and expected to cost dollars 185m each. the vessels are to be constructed at daewoo shipbuilding yard in south korea. this was india's second major lng transportation deal; and sci, the public sector shipping monolith, which owns roughly half of the country's ocean-going fleet of 239 vessels, has a stake in both of them, as does mol. 'mol is a professionally managed company whose cultural ethos is similar to ours,' says the goatee-bearded prabhat kumar srivastava, sci's chairman and managing director. 'our relationship is based on total transparency and trust; and we therefore feel comfortable with them. there may well be more such tie-ups in the future.' the earlier deal was also sealed with mol, which has a 60% stake in a joint venture named greenfield shipping company (gsc), with us energy major enron holding the remaining 20% equity. the three members will have joint ownership of the 135,000 cu m lng carrier, lng lakshmi, now under construction at the mitsui heavy industries shipyard in japan. when ready, the vessel will ferry 2.5m tpa of lng from rasgas of qatar to enron's mega-power facility at dabhol, near ratnagiri in southern maharashtra. however, to return to the petronet deal. the mol-sci consortium won the coveted contract by quoting a charter hire rate of dollars 68,900 per day, which was substantially lower than the bids of the two other competing consortia, misc-essar and exmar-great eastern shipping-indian oil corporation. 'the petronet lng deal was the most prestigious and important lng shipping project in the country, and we were very keen to secure it,' says mr srivastava. 'so we told our japanese partners to quote the best possible rates.' a 20% stake in the consortium formed with enron may only be sufficient to net sci a boardroom presence in gsc, but its 34.21% stake in the petronet lng shipping venture will allow the shipping major to exercise much more power on the latter company's board. there are other issues involved. 'if we had not emerged winners in petronet's shipping deal, it would have done us a lot of harm for the other lng shipping projects that are fast coming up in the country,' says mr srivastava. 'we have already made tremendous headway in lng shipping by being part of the dabhol project, and we were very keen to maintain the momentum.' experts rate sci as one of the best managed public sector enterprises; and the bottom line of the company reinforces this feeling. for the first nine months of the financial year 2000-01, sci had a sales turnover of rs22.03bn (dollars 474m), which was 16.2% better than the rs18.96bn recorded for the corresponding nine months of the previous year. the net profit zoomed from rs766m during the period april to december 1999 to rs2.32bn for the same nine months of 2000. while the results for the financial year ended march 31, 2001, are still being compiled, sci officials place the sales turnover at around rs29bn, and the net profit at just above the rs3bn mark. while the company's tankers have produced spectacular results, even the loss-making liner division is expected to turn round the corner. 'we have removed nearly 70% of the non-performing assets in the division, and the balance will be chopped off in the fiscal year 2001-02,' says sudhir s rangnekar, director, liner shipping division. recently, international consultants pricewaterhouse coopers (pwc) carried out a swot analysis for sci. they suggested a 'corporate transformation' of the company, apart from going ahead with the information technology initiatives taken earlier. the company went ahead and signed a memorandum of understanding with the ministry of shipping for the financial year 2001-02, whereby two new criteria will be used for judging the organisation's performance. 'a new criterion, 'corporate transformation project implementation', has been introduced in the mou, reflecting the emphasis that we are placing on enhancing the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations,' says mr rangnekar. 'it also reflects our keenness to develop greater customer focus through process re-designing and improvement, and adoption of the latest it systems and applications.' another new criterion introduced in the mou is 'annual operating earnings per employee', which is supposed continued on page 15 petronet project: the mol lng carrier, surya satsuma. mol is a member of the successful consortium. inset:s: kmsci director, bulk carriers and tankers (left) and sudhir s rangnekar, sci director, liner shipping (right). rangnekar california generators report record profits that dwarf ferc's latest refund orders 05/02/2001 foster electric report 3 (c) copyright 2001, foster associates, inc. about the same time that pg&e corp. and edison international announced combined write-offs of nearly $5.3 billion in unrecovered purchased power costs, four major california energy suppliers reported increases ranging from 126 percent to 281 percent in first-quarter 2001 revenues. meanwhile, ferc has issued new refund orders requiring many of these same generators to justify $587,000 in overcharges during march 2001. pg&e and southern california edison co.'s write-offs -- after a long delay, pg&e and edison during the middle of april confirmed what many knew was coming --huge write-offs for unrecovered purchased power costs during the year 2000. edison announced that it was writing off $2.5 billion in undercollected power costs for the year, leaving the company with a $1.9 billion loss for the year. edison chief john bryson was hopeful, nevertheless, that a recent memorandum of understanding (mou) his company signed with the state will allow edison to recover some of those costs and help keep its southern california edison co. (socal edison) affiliate out of bankruptcy. ""prompt implementation of the mou can avoid the large costs of a [socal edison] bankruptcy and make it possible for the company to restore its financial health and ability to maintain a reliable power grid,"" said bryson in a statement accompanying edison's financial results. whether bryson's hope for quick implementation of the mou will be realized is questionable. gov. gray davis has been having a hard time finding the necessary legislative support for the proposal, and to date, has been unable even to find a legislator to sponsor a bill to implement the mou. instead, several state legislators are exploring alternatives, including having the state buy socal edison's transmission assets as well as the whole utility and turn it into a state power agency. edison's northern california neighbor, pg&e corp., reported a strong growth in revenues for 2000 led by the strong performance of its energy trading unit, but that revenue growth was completely offset by the $4.5 billion in losses incurred by its now bankrupt pacific gas and electric co. utility subsidiary. ""while standard accounting rules required the utility to record a charge against earnings for unreimbursed wholesale and transition costs, taking this charge does not diminish our conviction that the utility is entitled under law to recover these costs, nor does it diminish our ongoing lawsuit in federal district court,"" said pg&e corp. chief robert glynn. generators' first-quarter revenue reports -- in sharp contrast with pg&e's and edison's financial performance, the parent companies of four of california's largest generators reported large jumps in first-quarter 2001 revenues. enron corp. reported revenues of $50.1 billion, a whopping 281 percent increase from a year earlier. the company owns only a small amount of wind generation in california, but sells power into the state through its portland general electric subsidiary and is an energy trader in the state. enron's commodity sales and service unit showed a 207 percent increase in first-quarter earnings. reliant energy inc. saw first-quarter earnings jump 215 percent to $13.3 billion. the company's wholesale energy business unit produced $216 million in operating income for the first quarter, up sharply from the $22 million loss the company reported a year earlier. reporting a slightly lower but still a substantial 165 percent jump in first-quarter revenues was dynegy inc. of the company's $14.4 billion in revenues for the period, its marketing and trading subsidiary realized $100.3 million in earnings, nearly double the $50.3 in earnings reported a year earlier. the parent company reported a 73 percent jump in first- quarter earnings over the previous year. duke energy corp. announced a 126 percent boost in first-quarter revenues to $16.5 billion, led by a 324 percent increase in earnings by wholesale energy unit. ferc's refund order -- similar to separate orders regarding january and february power sales in california, ferc on 4/16/01 issued a notice demanding that three generators justify $587,000 in combined power sales during march. ferc staff set a $300/mwh proxy clearing price for the month, and then applied it to the 14 hours of stage 3 power alerts that were declared during march in california. the staff's proxy prices for january and february were $273/mwh and $430/mwh, respectively. the clearing prices' fluctuations can be attributed to changes in operating costs, including fuel and emissions credits. the latest refund order is the smallest of the three, asking for cost support for just $587,000 in transactions, while the previous two orders cited a combined $124.4 million in potential overcharges. the three wholesale sellers being questioned by the current refund order --dynegy power marketing inc.; mirant california, mirant delta, and mirant portrero; and williams energy services corp. -- were named in the previous orders as well. once again, dynegy led the pack with the largest amount of potential refunds for march -- nearly $470,000. combined with the previous two orders, the company is on the hook for more than $46 million in potential refunds. mirant was asked by the latest order to justify close to $93,000 in march sales, and williams $25,500 in march sales."

"this is what scott sent to renee.? she is trying to figure out if he only sent it to her or others.? -----original message----- sent: tuesday, march 20, 2001 8:39 am -----original message----- sent: monday, march 19, 2001 5:17 pm perhaps this is a little too nice for me! moving thoughts ? < maybe god wants us to meet a few wrong people before meeting the right one so that when we finally meet the right person, we will know how to be grateful for that gift. when the door of happiness closes, another opens, but often times we look so long at the closed door that we don't see the one which has been opened for us. the best kind of friend is the kind you can sit on a porch and swing with, never say a word, and then walk away feeling like it was the best conversation you've ever had. it's true that we don't know what we've got until we lose it, but it's also true that we don't know what we've been missing until it arrives. giving someone all your love is never an assurance that they'll love you back! don't expect love in return; just wait for it to grow in their heart but if it doesn't, be content it grew in yours. it takes only a minute to get a crush on someone, an hour to like someone, and a day to love someone, but it takes a lifetime to forget someone. don't go for looks; they can deceive. don't go for wealth; even that fades away. go for someone who makes you smile because it takes only a smile to make a dark day seem bright. find the one that makes your heart smile. there are moments in life when you miss someone so much that you just want to pick them from your dreams and hug them for real! dream what you want to dream; go where you want to go; be what you want to be, because you have only one life and one chance to do all the things you want to do. may you have enough happiness to make you sweet, enough trials to make you strong, enough sorrow to keep you human, enough hope to make you happy. always put yourself in others' shoes. if you feel that it hurts you, it probably hurts the other person, too. the happiest of people don't necessarily have the best of everything; they just make the most of everything that comes along their way. happiness lies for those who cry, those who hurt, those who have searched, and those who have tried, for only they can appreciate the importance of people who have touched their lives. love begins with a smile, grows with a kiss and ends with a tear. the brightest future will always be based on a forgotten past, you can't go on well in life until you let go of your past failures and heartaches. when you were born, you were crying and everyone around you was smiling. live your life so that when you die, you're the one who is smiling and everyone around you is crying. please send this message to those people who mean something to you, to those who have touched your life in one way or another, to those who make you smile when you really need it, to those that make you see the brighter side of things when you are really down, to those who you want to let them know that you appreciate their friendship. and if you don't, don't worry, nothing bad will happen to you, you will just miss out on the opportunity to brighten someone's day with this message."

"cc: bcc: rob, cyndi, apologies for the delay in getting back to you on this subject. the european issues the one year retention period proposed by houston does cause europe a problem for two reasons: 1. the uk custom is to retain documentation for the limitation period of 7 years, ie just over the limitation period. not to do this could disadvantage enron in litigation in the uk ( and we have historically had some major litigation: cats, j block and etol). to destroy documents within this period could be negatively construed in the english courts. we asked slaughter and may to write us a brief paper on this subject which i attach. this bears out our views. 2. secondly the securities and futures authority generally stipulates a three year retention period for records of regulated business. the definition of such records includes any written communication between firm and customer with respect to regulated business. a proposed european email retention policy an email retention policy which meets all these requirements would be as follows: inbox: email messages in an employee's inbox will be deleted 30 days after receipt (no change from proposed policy) sent: email messages in an employee's sent file will be deleted 30 days after receipt (no change from proposed policy but it to confirm this does not also delete sent messages saved in folders ) trash: email messages in an employee's trash file will be deleted 15 days after being place in the employee's trash file (no change from proposed policy) folders: email messages in an employee's folders will be moved to archives 365 days after being placed in the folder. (instead of being deleted) archives: email messages in archives will be retained for 6 years after being archived, such that the total retention period for emails, from creation to deletion is 7 years (all new.) we would propose to introduce an identical policy for paper files. we would also propose not to take account longer limitation periods which prevail in other european countries on the basis that the additional exposure after a 7 year period in countries in which enron europe is not particularly active, is small. the judgement call i think in europe we have no choice but to introduce a three year retention period to comply with the sfa rules. i also think that this probably needs to apply generally rather than attempting to ring fence emails concerning regulated business. whether we then decide to retain for the additional 4 years seems to me to depend upon: whether we think this additional period introduces an unacceptable risk for enron as a whole when weighed against the probable benefits in europe; the cost of storage during the additional period is likely to be material. my personal view of the first point is that the risk for enron as a whole is probably small compared with the potential benefits for enron europe. the cost of a large disclosure exercise in english litigation can be huge, but we would only undertake this, or be forced to undertake this, if sufficient value were at stake. either way, we would probably be advantaged by having a comprehensive documentary record of events, which is what our opponent in the litigation process would in all likelihood have. i need to check that senior management here agrees with this analysis and will do so immediately. the second point i will check with our it people. we probably then need to discuss this. mark"

[fairley, david] each utility is obligated to provide the heat rate information to use in the appropriate exhibit and the stack model. as conditions change the utilities must update this info. we are tracking heat rates based on actual fuel usage. services and orig agreed yesterday to add language that requires a quarterly review of heat rate data to determine if the assumptions being used are satisfactiry -- it can never be exact, but it should be accurate within a band of acceptability. no gads. heat rates will be adjusted in the model as often as necessary to account for significant changes such as hotter ambient temps.. 2. are we comfortable that there are no permit restrictions? [fairley, david] yes, their units are too small. we have discussed this with the customer, and with our internal air permit guys. [rorschach, reagan] they have title v permits, and they are faxing them to us today. they have no run hour limitations on gas, however, they are limited on oil. will need to get that summary to kay as soon as possible. 3. we have determined that we won't deal with fuel oil, right? [fairley, david] we won't buy and sell fuel oil. we may dispatch on oil at start-up, or we may switch to oil and sell the gas if profitable, which constitutes a product transaction with the resulting profit split. [rorschach, reagan] we need to state that mdea and cities are responsible for maintaining fuel oil supplies. 4. we aren't making money on gas, right? [fairley, david] we make money on gas two ways. the first is outside the contract, and is basicly any internal profit on re-sale of gas to the cities. the second way we can make money on gas is when the gas trade is in the form of a product trade, and those procedures apply. 5. do we have a defn of costs that we like yet, and if so, how does it fit in to the picture? [fairley, david] yes, will send separately. 6. is there an up-to-date set of exhibits? [fairley, david] the marketing strategy, the trading and risk policy, and the description of asset management have been upated. the other exhibits have not been modified. the marketing strategy and trading & risk policy have been discussed at length with mdea (mdea commercial, not legal), and their comments/questions incorporated. 7. it would help if theh commercial part of the team could send me the following, in words and/or formulae: the defn and method of establishing the bogey (target production cost) formula can be an exhibit, which would be great for the commercial team to work on. [fairley, david] thought we had this covered in the definitions and obligations of the parties. will look at it again. conceptually, mdea, services group, and orig are in full agreement, so we need to make sure that the contract language is clear enough. [rorschach, reagan] see attached exhibit detailing the calc with an example. are we determined how we should deal with imbalances (part of cost of power)? [fairley, david] there are three considerations on this: (1) who wears imbalance exposure?, (2) who manages imbalances (hourly type activity), and (3) who pays for imbalances? imbalances are billed by entergy directly to mdea under their network services agreement. epmi's hourly desk manages the load/resource items hourly, but mdea has the exposure (physical and price) to imbalances. weather/load changes, and fluctuations in supply create hourly imbalances (they happen, they are uncontrollable, and we fix them) which epmi's hourly desk manages as part of the imbalance service described in the definitions and obligations of the parties. a different section in the contract states that mdea wears the exposure. how are we setting the bogey? formula? [fairley, david] the bogey is set when the load projection and stack models are run each day. both parties participate by providing certain necessary info and discussing results and planning the day's activities. [rorschach, reagan] records of bogey decisions will be archieved subject to audit? [fairley, david] yes, but they would be auditing something that is jointly derived each day. frankly, they would like to have less involvement; ie, they trust us to do it all, but we are requiring them to participate and buy in every day. two bogeys or one (gas and oil)? [fairley, david] one bogey for power. gas is an input for determining the bogey. [rorschach, reagan] bogey set day-ahead. what is defn of profit? i think i have the general idea, but a sentence or two would be helpful as a reality check. [fairley, david] this is in the pricing calc's. should we have a definition? what costs are included on the buy and sell side [fairley, david] see cost definition being provided separately. re stack model: a sentence or two describing what it is and how it is used. [fairley, david] see definition in my mark-up's to the main agreement. updated exhibit on facilities, contracted resources, operating limits. [fairley, david] services and orig are reviewing these, but other than what was mentioned above, probably no changes unless you see a specific area that is a problem. what information does mdea need for us to provide in order to split costs/profits? are we clear that cities buy gas, mdea buys/sells power? [rorschach, reagan] i will be getting exhibits of the reporting both daily and monthly. we need to make sure to limit our info providing responsibilities to those reports. it would be great if i could get one set of answers to these questions/issues, which has commercial buy in all around. thanks, kay"

"i got goldberg's comments this morning on the term sheet with the rockets. there are a number of technical comments which we will make. there are about four substantive comments that we are working on and will review with tracey ellison. two of the comments relate to you. goldberg wants to limit seats to a maximum of 20 per partner, not 300 total, because he said you said at the meeting that each partner would have a maximum of 20 seats. i didn't recall that any such statement by you was meant to limit the 300 seats but was merely an indication of about how many each partner would have. goldberg admitted the 300 seats was on the sheet handed out at the meeting. i can't believe goldberg is continuing to haggle on this issue. i think we should say that the maximum of 300 seats is what the partners approved and be done with it. the other issue is the amount of the referendum funding. goldberg said he understood that the rockets would match what the ""partners"" would put up. alternatively he wants the right for the rockets to raise part of their $1.5 million from others and get credit for it. i'm not sure whether the rockets would interfere with you raising your balance of the $1.5 million. in any case i need your input on this issue both for the rockets term sheet and determining how much we need to get advanced on the loan from the sports authority. john s. watson vinson & elkins llp 1001 fannin 2300 first city tower houston, tx 77002-6760 voice: 713/758-2556 fax: 713/615-5236 email: privileged and confidential: contains attorney-client communications and/or attorney work product"

"many of you have asked whether you should come into the office next week, especially if there is no guarantee of being paid for time worked after today. we want to encourage you to come to work. we continue to consider every option available to us as a company; and unfortunately, restructuring through bankruptcy is one of those options. your continued efforts during these trying times are critical to the company as we go through this decision making process. i still cannot say with certainty if or when we will file for bankruptcy. but you should be aware that, in general, the bankruptcy code provides protection for employee salaries and wages earned within 90 days of a petition filing to the extent of $4,650 per employee. i want you to know that if we file a bankruptcy petition, we intend to seek approval by the bankruptcy court to exercise that protection immediately and pay you for your time worked prior to any petition filing according to our regular payroll practices. additionally, enron would be obligated and will pay salaries and wages earned after a bankruptcy filing. for enron, where our value is directly tied to our employees, making sure that we meet these obligations will be a high priority. we are continuing to evaluate the ongoing resource needs of the company for each potential option we might pursue. of course, until we finalize those business decisions, we cannot make that determination. i know that this prolonged process is agonizing for you. i can only continue to assure you that we will notify you of your employment status as soon as we are able to do so. while terminated employees will tap into their own network of contacts as they look for new employment, we hope to do what we can to assist them. we will tap into the contacts we have as a company to aid terminated employees in their job search. we have already been in touch with several employers and many are interested in enron alumni. we will share more information on these efforts soon. i appreciate your continued patience and cooperation. ken"

"cc: bcc: jeff; in response to your questions, i cannot explain why everyone missed this bill in the past, i have raised it to the attention of my clients twice in the last two months. however, now that it is moving they have got the message. williams (kern river) is going to host a meeting today to create a coalition to oppose the bill. bev hansen knows where the meeting will take place. in addition to williams, i understand that questar, wspa, and other retail customer groups will join the coalition and oppose the bill. my client wild goose will also be listed in opposition, but they don't carry that much clout or name recognition so far. i am hopeful that other groups will surface soon. as for the bill itself, the problem is two fold. first, the cpuc decides what infrastructure to build at the request of the utilities. they take input from customers, but loretta is a command and control type all the way, and she will try to scare away private capital investment by interstate pipelines by mandating that the utilities build a gold-plated state-regulated system. while the bill does not (and cannot legally) bar interstate pipelines from coming into the state, it has provisions which will prevent large customers from signing up with the interstates. the large customers have to commit to take firm service on a 5 year basis with exit fees. if they don't take this, they can only get interruptible service from the utilities. many if not all large customers, especially generators cannot afford to take partial service from an interstate and have only interruptible access to the ldc system. this is the same dilemma that the rls tariff caused. my belief is that the obligation on the part of the commission to provide the utilities with cost recovery for the new investments will be used as justification by the utilities for another attempt to reinstitute the rls tariff or an onerous peaking rate. the commission will impose a premium price on service to customers who have not undertaken the firm 5 year commitment and will therefore be unable to economically take partial requirements service from an interstate. my view is based on sempra's reaction to the current peaking rate proposed decision and statements by lynch's office. this could interfere with enron gas sales over the interstates, and would certainly threaten any transwestern plans for building across the border into california, although that does not appear to be a high priority at this time. this bill will also make it more costly to develop gas supply arrangments for new power plants which had hoped to direct connect to interstate pipeline capacity for a portion of their needs. please call if you have further questions. mike day -----original message----- sent: tuesday, july 17, 2001 10:09 am cc: i've taken a quick look at the bill and have attached for easy viewing. few questions. mike, i understand from our conversation yesterday that your following this on behalf of questar. do we know if the other pipelines have been active in any discussions on this bill? what about the generators? have then been involved, since presumably, their in need of lots more capacity (and they're referenced in the bill)? what about large customers? they been screaming for more infrastructure, too, and many have blamed socalgas (and the puc) for not delivering it. do we know if pipelines, generators, large customers are supporting or opposing the bill? i'll try to check around, too, in between the electric mayhem. there doesn't seem to be anything in the bill that prevents the interstates from building into the state. if that's true, wouldn't the puc take those projects into account when doing its analysis and only require the utility to construct (and noncore to take) capacity that isn't already being met by others (i.e., interstates) bringing pipe into the state? any info you can provide on these fronts would be very useful. don't want enron too far out in front of opposition until we find out a bit more regarding 1) whose fer and agin it and 2) analysis of what the bill actually does/does not do. thanks again for the heads up. best, jeff (see attached file: 23xx.pdf) james d steffes cc: jeff susan j 07/17/2001 mara/na/enron, paul 07:43 am harry -- can you track down this bill and determine impact?

"cc: bcc: karl, thanks a lot. i have passed this information to grant masson who worked here on a related problem. he will get in touch with you regarding this technology. vince karl 07/24/2000 06:00 pm cc: vince, to follow up on the idea of a means for effectively tracking instantanious plant faliure utilising either system frequency or connection point voltage. the system frequency phase shift across a network will probably be the best option as this would allow alll significant deviations to be tracked along with relative network performance from a few points. i am currently chasing nemmco (au system operator) to get hold of a few weeks of 4 second metering data for the whole system to see if there is enough measurement consistency to prove one of the ideas. the idea follows along the lines (literally !) that when a unit fails it will introduce a shock into the system and reduce system frequency, which is then reacted to by frequency control services offered in by generators. the drop in frequency is noticable across the whole network and as one option may change the phase shift across the whole grid. the phase shift across the network is constantly changing due to loads and power factor correctrion devices switching on and off, however a unit failure may be distinct. the second option relates to how a unit fails, whereby if a circuit breaker is involved as in the case of uncontrolled shutdowns, then the outage will cause an rf pulse that should propogate across some of the network. transformers will attenuate the pulse, however it should be detectable many miles away from the fault location. measure the arrival time at several point on the network, work out the shift and backtrack on the network. part of the solution is already proven in lightning trackers. the solution may be made more simple by detecting the exact point on the sinewave that the unit failed (i.e. measuring the three phases at 1mhz and then sending the data through a dsp). this solution is more complex, however this should allow unit failure to be pinpointed to a station. the timing base for each of the nodes may be sourced from gps timing, self locating at the same time ! will send you some links and documents for potentail hardware and setups. karl."

"cc: bcc: david, during today's var coordination meeting we had a discussion of issues related to mapping of the forward price curves into core locations. mapping is a necessity dictated by the limitations of the computer system: we have to reduce the dimensionality of the problem to stay within the bounds of available cpu memory. also, in some cases the quality of price discovery is poor and it's difficult to model the price curves independently: we solve the problem by mapping them into more liquid and better behaved core locations curves. we have agreed on the following: 1. winston will investigate the it side and determine to what extent we can increase the number of forward price curves that are simulated as basic (core) curves. he will investigate the impact of a larger number of the core curves on the time required to complete the var run. 2. the curves associated with the biggest 10-20 positions in each commodity should be modeled as core curves (i.e. no mapping into other locations). it makes sense to monitor the biggest risks separately and avoid aggregating them into less transparent aggregates. 3. the results of an automated clustering (mapping) procedures should be systematically monitored by a human and corrected if they misrepresent the risks of the trading positions. this responsibility should be vested with one person (right now the responsibility is dispersed through the organization and this means in practice that nobody is responsible). research can allocate one person to this task; cooperation of trading and rac will be critical. vince"

_____________________________________________________________________ e x t r e m e m a r k e t c o m m e n t a r y _____________________________________________________________________ the stock indexes soared to new highs for the month following this morning's surprise move by the federal reserve to cut interest rates by 50-basis points to 4.50%. the nasdaq rallied over 9% as the news ignited a buying frenzy. traders shifted their focus following the announced rate cut to the positive aspects of quarterly profit statements. technically, both the nasdaq and s&p index gapped higher on the open thereby confirming upside breakouts of this year's downtrend lines. this week's gains have turned weekly momentum indicators bullish signaling sideways to higher prices are possible this spring. the dow also soared to a new high for the month following this morning's unexpected interest rate cut that caught the market off guard. the dow was up over 460 points during the session and traded above trading range support crossing at 10,292.30 and the february/march downtrend line crossing near 10,600. while a round of profit taking is possible ahead of the weekend, today's strong performance as set the stage for additional gains this spring. interest rates june bonds posted a key reversal up on wednesday following today's surprise cut in interest rates. traders quickly began to speculate on the size of the next rate cut, which traders seem to think will be another 50- basis points at the may 15 fomc meeting. additional strength on thursday would confirm today's reversal pattern thereby signaling that a short-term bottom has been posted. stochastics and the rsi are very oversold and turning neutral to bullish with today's rebound hinting that a low is in or near. the crb index closed slightly higher on wednesday but near session highs following a late session rally in soybeans and copper. nevertheless, today's close below this month's uptrend line is a clear warning to traders to use caution as a short-term top may be in place. closes above 216.40 are needed to keep this month's rally alive. energy markets were mixed on wednesday following tuesday's bearish api inventory data for crude oil. the latest api data showed that crude oil inventories have risen to 315.2 million barrels, the highest level since august 24, 1999. today's sell off led to a breakout below april's uptrend line thereby increasing the odds that june crude oil might have posted a short-term top. a short covering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of today's losses leaving the door open for sideways trading on thursday. stochastics and rsi are overbought but remain bullish. june heating oil gapped down and closed lower on wednesday due to spillover weakness from crude oil and the lower than expected decline in distillate inventories on tuesday's api reports. today's sell off turned a number of short-term momentum indicators that have become overbought neutral to bearish signaling that a short-term top has likely been posted. today's mid- range close leaves the door open for sideways trading on thursday. june unleaded gas soared to new contract highs in afternoon trading due to ongoing concerns over summer gasoline supplies. session highs fell short of testing weekly resistance crossing at 103.50. the rising adx (a trend-following indicator) is bullish and suggests that additional strength into early-may is possible. june henry hub natural gas extended tuesday's loss following the latest aga report that showed natural gas inventories rose by 64 billion cubic feet last week. this increase in inventory was higher than traders had expected and eased concerns over summer natural gas supplies. a short covering bounce ahead of the close tempered some of today's losses leaving the door open for sideways trading on thursday. currencies the june dollar posted a key reversal down after session highs fell short of testing this month's high crossing at 117.89. today's inter-meeting interest rate cut by the federal reserve failed to attract following through buying in the afternoon session. additional weakness on thursday would confirm today's bearish reversal pattern thereby increasing the chances that a double top has likely been posted. the june swiss franc and d-mark closed higher on wednesday due to late-session short covering rallies. early weakness pushed the swiss franc toward last fall's lows however, selling dried up near minor support crossing at .5635. additional strength on thursday would confirm today's spindle bottoms and would set the stage for additional short covering into early-may. the june canadian dollar closed lower on wednesday but near session highs due to a short covering bounce ahead of the close. the late session bounce could spillover into thursday's session however, momentum indicators are turning neutral to bearish warning traders that last week's high might have marked a double top. look for sideways to lower trading into the end of april. the june japanese yen closed above last week's high crossing at .8205 to confirm the recent trendline breakout and open the door for a test of the late-march high crossing at .8327. stochastics and rsi are bullish signaling sideways to higher prices into early-may are possible. precious metals june gold managed to close modestly higher due to a short-covering bounce ahead of the close. momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that additional gains near-term are still possible if june can clear resistance crossing at 265.50. closes below april's uptrend line crossing near 259 would signal an end to this month's corrective bounce. july silver extended tuesday's loss but like june gold managed to close near session highs due to a short covering bounce ahead of the close. nevertheless, this week's setback suggests that july silver will continue to extend this spring's trading range into early-may. closes above 4.505 or below 4.31 are needed to confirm a trading range breakout. july copper soared to new highs for the month due to today's strong performance in the equity markets. prospects for an improving economy due to the latest interest rate cut underpinned today's rally in july copper and confirmed the recent trendline breakout. the stage is set for additional gains with the late-march reaction high crossing at 80.15 marking the next upside objective. grains may corn closed fractionally lower on wednesday amidst conflicting planting ideas. the latest weather forecast are calling for additional precip across the midwest, which could delay fieldwork. however, the latest planting progress report shows that corn planting thus far has progressed at an average pace. this week's setback has turned a number of momentum indicators neutral to bearish hinting that monday's high might have marked a double top. traders will be looking at thursday's export sales report for near-term direction. however, bulls are not holding out much hope for a bullish sales report on thursday. it appears that may corn will remain range bound between 2.15 and 2.02 1/2 for the time being until the market can get a better handle on planting progress and early growing conditions. may wheat posted an upside reversal on wednesday as spring wheat planting delays offered mild support to the market. additional support came from this year's winter wheat crop ratings, which remain well below last year's levels. gains were limited as export demand remains quiet. technically, momentum indicators remain bullish signaling that sideways to higher prices into early-may are possible. soybean complex may soybeans posted a key reversal up on wednesday due to light fund buying and a tight cash market. may opened under pressure following weakness in overnight trading and posted a new contract low before a short covering bounce unfolded. light support came from the latest weather forecast, which have taken some of the rain out of next week's outlook. may beans are at an important crossroads. closes above 4.44 or below 4.26 1/2 are needed to clear up near-term direction in the market. july soybean meal also posted a key reversal up on wednesday due to spillover strength from soybeans. additional gains on thursday are needed to confirm today's bullish reversal pattern. momentum indicators remain neutral to bearish warning traders to use caution as closes above last week's high crossing at 154 are needed to renew the rally off the late-march low. livestock june hogs closed sharply lower on wednesday due to profit taking and spillover weakness from bellies. weakness in the product market also weighed on prices. losses were limited due to mostly steady cash bids as traders began to position themselves ahead of friday's cold storage report. today's low-range close leaves the door open for sideways to lower prices on thursday. momentum indicators are diverging and turning neutral to bearish warning traders that an important top may be in or near. june cattle settled lower on wednesday due to rumors of cash bids of $77, which is down $2.00 from last week. feedlot sources confirmed those rumors after the close, which sets the stage for a softer opening on thursday. june cattle have spent the past three sessions consolidating above this year's shallow uptrend line crossing near 71.77. multiple closes below this support level would renew the decline off march's high and open the door for a possible test of this year's low crossing at 70.52 later this spring. stochastics and rsi are bearish signaling sideways to lower prices near-term are possible. food & fiber july coffee closed sharply higher on wednesday due to short covering. today's high-range close leaves the door open for additional gains on thursday. however, upside potential appears limited ahead of the upcoming brazilian harvest. july cocoa closed slightly lower on wednesday as it consolidates around the 50% retracement level of this winter's rally crossing at 985. while momentum indicators remain bearish they are also diverging, which is a warning to bears not to press their hand at this time as a double bottom might have been posted with this week's low. closes above 1020 are needed to temper the near-term bearish outlook in the market. july sugar closed lower on wednesday filling monday's gap at 800. a late session rebound tempered some of today's losses leaving july above this winter's downtrend line. momentum indicators remain bullish however, closes above last week's high at 821 are needed to open the door for a larger-degree rebound this spring. july cotton posted a downside reversal on wednesday after early strength due to short covering lead to a jab above minor resistance crossing at 48.90. however, july failed to attract follow- through buying on today's move to new highs as funds want to look at thursday's export sales report before deciding weather or not to exit their short positions. momentum indicators are very oversold warning bears not to press their hand at this time. daily extreme commentary is brought to you by

"the homework assignment of the fourth grade was to have each child get their parents to tell them a story with a moral at the end of it. the next day the kids came back and one by one began to tell their stories. kathy said, ""my father's a farmer and we have a lot of egg-laying hens. one time we were taking our eggs to market in a basket on the front seat of the pickup when we hit a bump in the road and all the eggs went flying and broke and made a mess."" ""and what's the moral of the story?"" asked the teacher. ""don't put all your eggs in one basket!"" ""very good,"" said the teacher. ""now, lucy?"" ""our family are farmers too. but we raise chickens for the meat market. we had a dozen eggs one time, but when they hatched we only got ten live chicks. and the moral to this story is, don't count your chickens until they're hatched."" ""that was a fine story, lucy. johnny, do you have a story to share?"" ""yes, ma'am, my daddy told me this story about my aunt karen. aunt karen was a flight engineer in desert storm and her plane got hit. she had to bail out over enemy territory and all she had was a bottle of whiskey, a machine gun and a machete. she drank the whiskey on the way down so it wouldn't break and then she landed right in the middle of 100 enemy troops. she killed seventy of them with the machine gun until she ran out of bullets, then she killed twenty more with the machete till the blade broke and then she killed the last ten with her bare hands."" ""good heavens,"" said the horrified teacher, ""what kind of moral did your daddy tell you from that horrible story?"" ""don't fuck with aunt karen when she's been drinking."""

"business highlights enron freight markets despite an eroding economy and increasing scrutiny of enron, enron freight markets finished a record month in october, completing more than 4,000 transactions (50% growth from september) and adding over 200 new counterparties. volumes were especially strong in the last 10 days of the month. one of the big sources of transaction growth was increased volume from other major freight intermediaries, substantially bolstering efm's efforts to develop a wholesale market. enron global markets coal increased liquidity in the prompt months has brought more players into the spot rail market. traditionally a thin market in the otc market, the coal group is capitalizing on increased interest by introducing several new eol rail products. on the csx rail line, there will be two 12,500 btu products with different sulfur contents - 1.2 pound (or compliance) and 1.6 pound. the csx contract will be fob rail in the big sandy or kanawha rail districts. on the norfolk southern rail line, there will be two similar 12,500 btu products, however, fob rail in the thacker or kenova rail districts. the coal group intends to bring these products on line within a week for the cash book, and hopefully extend them to the forward markets. enron industrial markets lumber enron's lumber trading group recorded a record 33 transactions on clickpaper.com for the week ended november 11, 2001 for a gross notional value of approximately $1,200,000. this compares to the group's prior weekly average of 5 online transactions with a notional value of approximately $140,000. the increase in activity is due to the launch of the lumber group's new futures-like fixed price forward contracts, which began trading last week. ""we are very excited about the overwhelming market acceptance of our new forward contracts which we expect will revolutionize the way lumber is traded"" says john jacobsen, a manager with eim's lumber trading group. we expect to see continued increases in our online trading activity as we start actively marketing them. what makes this week's activity even more promising is the fact that the cash market has been fairly quiet due to the uncertainty surrounding a softwood lumber dispute between the us and canada."" welcome new hires egm - troy rawlings, tom beam, jo crowder eim - leonardo cardosa, roger pederson, michael arlia transfers (to or within) ena - jacob shupe, david hernandez, john suarez, erika edwards eim - thomas briggs, jessica nunez, ben thomason egm - diana luu, sheila pardo nuggets & notes enrononline figures below are the latest figures for enrononline as of november 5 * total life to date transactions > 1,650,000 * life to date notional value of transactions > $ 913 billion enron wholesale services best practice tips ordering/locating skytel/blackberry items in the ibuyit eprocurement catalog pagers and accompanying service plans: ews eprocurement users should go to the catalog under office supplies. enter ""skytel pagers"" as the quick search text. tip: all users must select a service plan in addition to the pager. handheld devices: ews eprocurement users should go to the catalog under it hardware. enter ""blackberry"" as the quick search text. tip: no need to select a separate service plan. a service plan is combined in the catalog with each handheld device. information required when ordering skytel items pagers and handheld devices: the user's eid* and name are required for all skytel items. after adding the item(s) to the shopping cart, the requester must click the line item details icon (magnifying glass) and enter the user's eid and name under the purchase order text tab. the order cannot be processed without this information. this will ensure that the ongoing monthly service plan charges are assigned correctly to the user's cost center. *if eid is unknown, users should go to ehronline to view their eids. tip: if you wish to swap out a pager for a handheld device, make sure to include your existing pager phone number in the po text. news from the global flash update on enron europe following on from last week's memo on the health of the business, here's a snapshot of the activities we are pursuing currently to provide customers and investors with confidence in our business: we are continuing to work on trading liquidity, which to date is going well. we are transacting with most of our counterparties, but we are spending a significant amount of commercial and commercial support time working on putting credit agreements in place. these credit agreements tend to focus on netting out exposures between different enron business units (for example uk gas and uk power) and providing collateral arrangements whereby neither one of us can owe more than a pre-agreed amount without starting to ""pay as you go"". during these tough times, our priorities right now are - preserve cash (as our credit rating has been downgraded, our ability to keep maximum cash liquidity is critical). - insure that we are getting paid when we should get paid. in other words, we are focusing efforts on accounts receivable that should have been paid and are now overdue (something that is always important, but even more so now). - reduce our expenses to the greatest extent possible. - keep making money. so please let us know how we can help you help us get the job done. remember, the key thing for enron at present is that we put all our efforts into making money, keeping costs down and ensuring that all cash due to us is collected on time. focusing on the business at hand will be critical to helping us demonstrate our overall strength. enron nordic energy restructuring enron nordic energy last week took steps to restructure its operations with respect to finland. moving forward, enron nordic energy will continue to service the finnish market from its oslo office, offering a range of products including portfolio and risk management services. this move is not indicative of a withdrawal of enron's business from the finnish market, but rather has been initiated in an effort to rationalise enron's functions and services in the region. enron succeeds in completing its first bi-lateral power transaction inside italy congratulations are due to the italian desk for concluding its first power transaction inside italy. the team succeeding in buying 5mw of peak energy for december 2001 from italian wholesaler, energ.it, and are selling it to enel trade, the trading arm of the incumbent energy company, enel. energ.it is mainly active in sardinia and off-takes power from the aes plant in ottana, sardinia. ""although this is only a small deal it demonstrates the market's appetite to transact."" says daniela uguccioni, enron's italian power trader. ""due to the slow progress of liberalisation in italy, we are still limited to doing back-to-back transactions such as this, however this is definitely a step in the right direction"" adds paul mead, director of regional power trading. ""the exciting part of this deal is that enel will now trade with us inside italy, something we have been trying to do with them for years."" new online metals product last week saw the launch by enron metals of online 'averaging' contracts for copper and aluminium. 'fixed for float' and 'month on month' averaging contracts are now available for the 'nearby months' (i.e.up to three months ahead) providing a useful tool for hedgers. the introduction of this product online, which is of particular interest for producers and consumers, came in response to customer demand. the initial response has been positive as last week saw the first trades and we are already seeing requests for the product to be made available for other metals. polish power market gathers momentum as enron signs second master trading agreement enron poland, which recently closed its first-ever otc transaction with poland's largest generator pke, has signed a second master trading agreement with one of the top ten regional distribution companies, energa gdansk. the agreement will provide the basis for future bi-lateral electricity transactions. ""we hope to close our first deal with gdansk in q4"", says jarek dybowski, enron's director of power trading in poland. business highlights from down under power desk sees promising market growth in the energy market, enron australia continues to build its presence year-on-year. enron australia's results at the end of the third quarter showed a 50% increase in volumes, an 80% increase in transactions, and a 300% increase in p&l. the advent of a competitive ancillary services market in q4 provides scope for increasing the power team's activity further by the end of the year. pacific solar rec trade enron australia has secured a renewable energy deal with pacific solar, a company that is developing solar photovoltaic systems for the rooftops of the world. the transaction gives enron the right to purchase all of the renewable energy certificates (recs) generated by the pv units sold in australia. pacific solar is also selling its systems in europe though italian company, eurosolare. the deal is the first exclusive offtake agreement enron has secured in the nascent australian rec market. legal stuff the information contained in this newsletter is confidential and proprietary to enron corp. and its subsidiaries. it is intended for internal use only and should not be disclosed. <embedded paintbrush picture>"

"adheres to tx deal. socal ed exec sees bankruptcy if lawmakers reject deal updated: friday, april 20, 2001 02:54 pm?et ? ? los angeles (dow jones)--edison international (eix, news, msgs) unit southern california edison will go into bankruptcy if state legislators don't approve a deal for the state to buy the company's transmission lines, an edison executive told reporters friday. ""it's the agreement or bankruptcy. legislators need to understand the consequences of having no agreement,"" said bob foster, socal ed's senior vice president of external affairs. ""we've had almost a year of instability and chaos, and having 2-3 more years of uncertainty isn't the way to handle public policy."" ?in this article ?symbol last change ?eix 10.32 -0.66? ?pcg 8.90 +0.17? ?sre 24.45 -0.65? ?index ?dow jones 10579.85 -113.86? ?nasdaq 2163.29 -18.85? ? ? it wasn't immediately clear if foster meant socal ed would declare bankruptcy, or if he thought the utility would be forced into bankruptcy by creditors if legislative approval of the deal falls through. gov. gray davis is having a tough time convincing legislators to accept the deal, which must have legislative backing in order to be implemented. as previously reported, several key lawmakers have said the deal would need to be heavily amended before it could pass. the terms of the deal, signed last week by davis and edison international chief executive john bryson, call for the state to buy socal ed's 12,000 miles of transmission lines for $2.76 billion and to allow the utility to issue bonds backed by ratepayers so that it can recoup $5.5 billion in unrecovered power costs. davis told senate democrats wednesday he would consider amending the agreement based on their input, and asked the lawmakers to appoint a special committee to work with his administration on possible revisions. foster said that while small changes may be acceptable, the meat of the agreement must not change. ""i'd be foolish to say you can't change a word, but the fact is that the essence of the agreement must stay the same. it's an integrated, balanced agreement and it must stay that way. if you pull something out, you need to add something in,"" foster said. the deal's ""essence"" ensures the utility will eventually become creditworthy again, foster said. as reported, some lawmakers have said ratepayers and taxpayers may be better off if socal ed declares bankruptcy, especially now that pg&e corp. (pcg, news, msgs) unit pacific gas & electric co. has sought bankruptcy-law protection and is no longer negotiating with the state. ""i still don't see how ratepayers could be any worse off with (socal ed) in bankruptcy than they would with the governor's plan,"" state sen. debra bowen, d-redondo beach, said thursday. bowen is chairwoman of the senate energy committee. bankruptcy would be worse than any perceived shortcomings in the socal ed agreement, foster said, and the utility will spend the next week trying to educate lawmakers on why that is so. one reason is that the state may need to purchase more ""net-short"" power to keep the lights on if the utility's contracts with small generators, or qualifying facilities, are rejected by a bankruptcy judge ""twenty-seven percent of our customer demand is met by qualifying facility contracts. if those get rejected, the state's net-short expands from its current 32%...also, our distribution systems are old and require a substantial amount of investment (to keep running). if we go into bankruptcy, there'll be no investment,"" foster said. foster said he thought legislators' skepticism about the deal was partly due to lack of knowledge about its intricacies. ""i believe when members fully understand what this agreement is, they will understand it's decent and preferable to bankruptcy. the agreement is 38 pages but it's packed and requires explanation...there are real benefits here for the state,"" foster said. foster also said it wasn't yet clear whether the deal would require another rate hike on top of the 3-cent-kilowatt-hour increase passed by regulators last month. that's partly because regulators haven't yet determined how revenue from that rate hike will be divided between the utility and the state's department of water resources for its power purchases. ""we need to understand how the present rates will be allocated, and that depends on what the dwr is going to need. under some assumptions we will be able to fit the deal under current rates. if we can get qualifying facility costs to a manageable level and the dwr can clearly indicate what it needs in revenue going forward, it's possible,"" foster said. -by jessica berthold; dow jones newswires; ;"

($88,816.33) and nov. ($39,881.55) midland power coop electric bills to ena have not been paid, and probably won't be until the bankruptcy proceeding unfolds (if at all). 3) under bankruptcy law, a utility cannot discontinue service to a debtor for not paying invoices outstanding at the time bankruptcy is filed and bill rapp has asked ena's bankruptcy attorneys to provide the attached notice to midlands power cooperative. 4) under supervision of the bankruptcy court, future invoices received after bankruptcy was filed (dec 2) will be paid by ena (if they have the cash?). 5) ena's nomination of 2,010 dth/d of ""monthly fuel gas payable"" from nng has been confirmed and is flowing. (this is their source of cash!?) 6) gas accounting will continue to pay the ""monthly demand charge"" ($64,549), and the ""monthly peak compression service charges"" (ranges from $300 to $40,000). the next payment is not due until the end of december. 7) ena's o&m payment to nng for motor operation ($4,072.82) will be billed on the 20th of each month. one month's payment should have been outstanding when bankruptcy was filed and therefore not paid, however, it was actually paid to nng on dec. 6th. 8) ena's next $320,000 ""peak associated payment"" is not due to nng until july 1, 2002. there is no certainty when dealing with a bankrupt entity, however, this is where we are today. the theme i keep hearing is business as usual. tom, someone from operations should probably follow-up with midland power (i suggest a boat load of empathy regarding their $128,000 in limbo) after they get the ena letter. charlie graham phone fax oma 0629 << file: 56q101!.doc >>"

"as most of you know, we met recently with caesar pelli architects to discuss art space outdoors on the enron campus and on the first two floors of the new building (public spaces.) the conclusions were: 1) the best outdoor site is in antioch park and will require coordination with a landscape firm pitching a renovation of the park; 2) the only interior wall feasible is the tall space outside the auditorium on the first floor. you have been copied on an e-mail regarding potential discussions with jeff koons for the antioch park project. in an effort to continue to identify (in a detailed fashion) the other interior art spaces available to us, we are awaiting scheduling of a meeting with gensler (interior architects for floors 3-40.) i will let you know as soon as we have dates/times available. at this time, i hope to have more information and seek input on the koons discussions and to suggest a timetable for proceeding on a presentation to skilling/lay and artist discussion. lea"
"cc: bcc: here are my observations: i agree with rusty re: the put option complicating things for us. second, there has to be an absolute end to this agreement at some point. if we want to have an automatic extension by commencing construction, there still needs to be a date certain after which we can go forward without them no matter what. in other words, if we want to add the language rusty suggested, it should be limited to x months after the expiration of the option agreement. we'll need to run this back through accounting. i really don't like the inclusion of the language in paragraph 5. if we add the language requested in paragraph 5, we need to run this agreement back through accounting, and we may need to add some other additional language. i don't know if rusty and fred think we may need a zoning change for this parcel. kay rusty stevens 09/14/2000 04:45 pm cc: fred i am in receipt of the fehr's comments to our option agreement. in reviewing them, i have the following comments: the paragraph (2) change that says they can compel us to buy their land upon a triggering event occurring is not going to work, because this is a put option on their part which hurts our hard cost avoidance issues. we carefully reworded previous put option language to avoid this. also, how can we be bound to a deal when the agreement has expired ? i think we would need to say that ""if we decide to build the plant after the option period expires, then that would serve to extend the term of this agreement, however, if the option agreement expires unexercised for a one year period then we won't be bound to the deal. if the provisions of his comment (5) are indeed parallel to another similar paragraph in the document i don't have a problem with it, but ""specific performance"" scares me in general. your (collective) call. lets wrap this one up fast. i want to resolve it soon so i can use it as leverage with ledford and not have him influence them. he picked a good to go on vacation, but is back in on monday. i also told the fehr's that if we could do this before the 15th i would go for $185,000 vs. $175,000. since we were about five days longer than promised, i can justify the delay to end of next week, but i don't want them to think i was just blowing smoke on the extra $10,000. fred : refresh my memory on who i need to go to for the option payment check ?"

"three comments (""severe"" concerns?) which i am sorry i was unable to deliver before the draft order went out to all parties: 1. i share robert fallon's concern. although the judge did say at monday's prehearing conference that she would accept a party's ""ballpark estimate"" of its ripple claims, the express inclusion of a procedure for ripple claim offers of proof could later harm a party that remains silent on this issue, despite the draft order's statement that offers of proof are ""not required."" 2. the draft order might benefit from an up-front definition of ripple claims. first, though, we need to make sure that we all agree on the meaning of the terms that we are using. depending on how we define ripple claims, it seems to me that a counterclaim or a cross-claim could indeed be a ripple claim, and we need to be sure that we are not prejudiced by failing to assert such claims now. a counterclaim is my claim against somebody who has asserted a claim against me. a cross-claim is my claim against a third party who has not asserted a claim against me. (as for ""offset,"" i have been under the impression that we have been using that term to describe a deduction that may validly be made from a refund amount that i am deemed to owe another party -- particularly, a deduction occasioned by that other party's unpaid bill from me.) presumably, each of us knows who sold power to us and the prices for those sales. therefore, should i so choose, i already have the ability to assert a refund claim against any of the entities that sold to me -- whether the seller has made a claim against me (making my refund claim a counterclaim) or has not made a claim against me (making my refund claim a cross-claim). but given my opposition to any refunds in this case, i would prefer to refrain from asserting my own refund claims (whether counterclaims or cross-claims), while reserving my right to do so in the future should the need arise. perhaps we should define a ripple claim simply as any refund claim that could potentially be asserted by a party that has expressed an opposition to refunds in this case. that way, we could maintain a unified front of opposition to refunds without being prejudiced in any way from seeking our own refunds if it should come to that. in testimony and other filings, we would make it clear that any refund directive would open the pandora's box of wave after wave of ripple claims, but we would not need to quantify them now. 3. the draft order, in the title, ""defer[s] ripple claims to a later phase in this proceeding."" we want this proceeding to die -- not to live on in later phases. shouldn't the order simply exclude ripple claims as beyond the scope of the proceeding?

assuming the stock price doesn't double every few month= s, in effect preventing enron from getting the public equity markets to pay= my compensation? =20 8.=09also there has been a significant change on the acceptable cut in term= s of the prc, where before enron was penalizing the ""have issues"" classific= ation of the prc, now it feels like they are trying to get rid of 20% of th= e pool. reinforcing the first paragraph. 9.=09offer of salary is cloaked and we don't know where we can end up. 10.=09i believe there is a big disconnect between recruiting team and the h= ead office. as a result, the sales pitch given to recruits leads to false e= xpectations. and obviously when those expectations are not met, we all know= the consequences. 11.=09the rest of the downtown houston energy concerns are paying much high= er base 12.=09can we have a list of companies we benchmark compensation against? i= s it really wall street and consulting? if so, i'd like to see the names o= f the firms. new york is not that expensive that the ""well they're in new = york"" excuse covers all discrepancies. it feels like we must be benchmarki= ng against second or third tier mba recruiters. 13.=09there's a feeling among the associate pool that you need to be in a s= ecure, established, money making division in order to guarantee a average o= r above prc for the end of the year and therefore not be in the two bottom = brackets and not be fired. that goes against the long- term reputation of = enron as a company where you are rewarded for taking risks.=20 14.=09attempting to get into rotation and expect competition from others ro= tating but do not expect to get displaced by a 1st rotation associate that = is placed by the aa pool. 15.=09assignment of 1st rotation was chosen for me and the job function was= more of an analyst function than it was an associate function. why can't = alumni from your school help to find a rotation to match the desires of the= in coming candidate? 16.=09manage expectations...don't need to hear about 26 year old trader and= louise kitchen's rise to fame with enron online...creates an expectation t= hat those are more common occurrences than they really are. 17.=09it doesn't feel like there's a lot to do in all areas, nonetheless so= mething between 60 and 100 new associates coming in these fall: first, why = that many? second, do they know what they are getting into? 18.=09the main issues have to do with compensation being well below market = - we have always been assured that the bonus and options more than made up = for the disparity, but given the declining stock value, lack of meaningful = rotations and decrease in the overall level of satisfaction with the progra= m this is becoming a much bigger issue. 19.=09enron is so secretive about salaries that associates have no idea wha= t the upside looks like. working for beans in year 1 is ok if years 2-5 ar= e excellent. we really have no idea what to expect for salary or bonus aft= er the program is over. 20.=09salary well below market (base salary and value of options/bonus) - e= ven if they bring us up to the 2001 offers (which are rumored to be under m= arket), we have 1 year or more experience with the class coming in and will= be paid the same amount? 21.=09lack of quality rotations (cuts in ebs, ees, ect...) 22.=09level of responsibility is well below expectations/maturity level 23.=09compensation for associates is at the bottom of the pay scale for top= b-schools. not only in comparison to ib and consulting, but also compared= to specialties (brand management, etc.) that are at the lower end of the m= ba scale. it is cheaper to live in houston but our student loans are not i= ndexed by location. other energy companies here in town even pay more. =20 24.=09the enron contract is designed to retain employees with sticks and no= t carrots. there is no other company i know that expects full repayment of= a signing bonus 18 months after the start date. if the program is truly s= pecial people should not be forced to repay anything-enron should deliver w= hat they advertise and people will stay. the 18-month lock up period sugge= sts a concern with retention that is being met with a penalty to the associ= ate and not an improvement in the program.=20 25.=09how much do managers make assuming certain business and individual pe= rformance levels? i've got no clue but i'm wondering why it such a big sec= ret?=20 26.=09the prc process does not encourage people to experiment in their rota= tions as enron implies. for example, if you take a rotation in an area you= know nothing about, you will lose in the prc because you are still learnin= g the job. similarly, if you were a trader and go to a trading rotation, y= ou will be rewarded a prc time. 27.=09there are too many associates and too few analysts. too many associ= ate rotations become exercises in finding something to do. too often, asso= ciates think to themselves, i remember doing this several years ago as an u= ndergrad, why am i doing this again. 28.=09they should present the program for what it is -an internal labor poo= l where associates find their own rotations depending on what is available = and who they know. the program does not match people with jobs and should = make it clear that you will be interviewing for jobs, etc upon entry into t= he program. this is not because they want associates to have choice, but r= ather because they have no proven record of placing people in the rotations= . =20 29.=09if we are not going to be competitive with wall street and consulting= , we should at least be competitive with our energy competitors. i don't k= now what companies we are benchmarking against but i guarantee we are not k= eeping up. small differences can create a lot animosity towards the progra= m. when a person who didn't get into enron but got into a competitor makes= materially more money from the start, people start believing they have jus= t been sold a lot of hype. 30.=09not enough development during rotations - even associates who end up = learning a lot don't necessarily enjoy their rotations because they don't f= eel part of the team 31.=09not getting to pick your rotations or at least interview for your fir= st rotation is a moral buster as well. additionally, it can waste a lot of= time in the case that someone is forced into a group or position they have= no interest in. 32.=09compensation - many gave up lucrative offers elsewhere for a lower ba= se and bonus package from enron because the stock price movement promised l= arge equity based compensation. also, it was very difficult to find out wh= at full first year bonuses were during the recruiting process. most wrongl= y believed that this indicated that the bonuses were competitive versus oth= er leading mba avenues. how much money do people at enron make assuming th= e stock price performs1. great 2. okay, 3. poor? =20 33.=09responsibility - when you are getting recruited you always here the l= ouise kitchen, john arnold, and greg whalley examples as if that is normal.= we need to stop doing that. enron's slowing growth rate and failure in e= verything outside of gas and power trading will super fast promotions as we= look more and more like a large corporation. =20 34.=09the program is designed to bring in too many associates and then let = them compete with each other until the weaker associates are driven out. i= f this is true, why not spend more time and money recruiting and bring in f= ewer, higher quality associates from the start - the process of weeding out= leaves everyone with a bad feeling. more importantly, you probably lose m= ore good people then you realize. 35.=09trading, trading, trading. on mba campus visits, enron gives the imp= ression that there are lots of corporate development & m&a, finance, and ot= her similar assignments available at enron. the reality seems that if you = are not interested in trading for a living, you are not on the company's ma= in commercial track any longer. 36.=09finding a rotation: information difficult to get; it is all networkin= g. this is fine, but i don't consider the a/a progrram a resource in this a= rea at all. if no one else does, we should cut any expenses they are incurr= ing for ""rotation placement"". 37.=09the skew on associate bonuses hurts morale. you can reward the high = performers without penalizing the good performers. recently, the word has = gotten around =09that the top 5% and the next 15% of the prc group got very= large bonuses while everyone below that level got very poor bonuses? this= distribution creates a small number of very happy people and a larger numb= er of unhappy people. 38.=09""i find it interesting that enron chooses to 1- adopt a business mode= l based upon free-market economics, and 2- pride itself on its intellectual= capital in an era in which the company moves toward being a financial serv= ices player rather than a firm with a tremendous physical presence. in sel= ecting an employer this was a huge selling point. i find it paradoxical, h= owever, that we have chosen to adopt a pay grade that could at best be desc= ribed as socialistic, and below market. in a labor market where intellectu= al capital is portable and our chief competitors have seen our competitive = advantage in the form of this asset, i can only believe that enron is posit= ioning itself to fall short in the years to come when j. aron, morgan stanl= ey, dynegy, el paso, etc. decide that the cheapest way to gain ground on en= ron is to higher this intellectual capital. without griping, i feel if not= hing else, workers at enron would like to be paid market rate for the talen= ts we possess. in our ""sales pitch"" we are told that enron benchmarks pay = against our energy competitors as well as comparable jobs on wall street. = i can say from experience that our compensation packages cannot hold a cand= le to the potential for a wall street style pay package, which leaves me bi= tter that the sales pitch was shallow, fell short, or was deliberately misg= uided. part of the problem, from an associates perspective, stems from enr= on promising the moon and then falling short on delivery. like a company t= hat fails to deliver on earnings in a tough market, punishment for such a s= hortfall is swift and severe. i truly believe enron is setting itself up f= or such a fall unless this matter is addressed swiftly. 39.=09in an extension of the contradiction between free market economics an= d socialistic patronage, i have come to notice that more and more departmen= ts are positioning themselves to hire associates under the guise that the a= ssociate promise to stay more than the required and desired six months. fu= rther, many desks, once happy with the performance of the associate, ask fo= r the ""option"" to retain the associate. however, no effort is made to comp= ensate the associate for essentially giving up the ""optionality"" embedded i= n a rotational program. in fact, many choosing to stay within a group have= made their experiences explicitly known to others that come prc time, they= have actually been slighted for cutting short their rotation and instead o= pting to join a unit full time. by removing the ability of business units = to promote a worker until conclusion of the 18-24 month period, hard workin= g, good-fit associates miss the opportunity to capitalize on what would see= m to be a natural fit for a full-time position, and the chance to alleviate= a significant source of discontent-compensation- which could be addressed = through the immediate promotion to the manager level. by allowing for prom= otion, associates could earn enhanced compensation, and department heads co= uld address hiring needs. rather, associates leave a unit disgruntled, fee= ling they are marking time in other units, potentially passing up an altern= ative that may be of great interest. additionally, a number of commercial = units have even gone so far as refusing to hire associates unless they are = in their third or fourth rotation, so as to retain a ""call option"" on an em= ployee that has run out of rotation alternatives. this practice cannot be = in the best interest of the desks, the program, or for that matter enron. = by pigeonholing employees in this matter, the significance and importance o= f rotations is greatly diminished, as is our work experience. this is just= ludicrous! department heads aren't looking to hire externally because of = the salary shortfall and our forced pay grade. rather, they are trying to = plug a manager level position with an associate salary. again, rather than= pay a competitive, performance-based wage, enron has adopted a tight-fiste= d, socialistic pay grade to better serve expenses. ultimately, this will l= ead to people seeking to ""rotate"" out of enron for the compensation the mar= ket will bare. =20 40.=09i think a/a provides an excellent opportunity to find the department = that you would like to work in through rotations and if you do a good job, = chances of advancing are much better for analysts and associates, than for = regular employees. 41.=09we get solid commercial responsibility from the get go - i doubt many= of the guys who went to ny had this. 42.=09we get lots of freedom to manage my own business as long as i produce= . 43.=09salaries: not in line with market. 44.=09mentors: not encouraged throughout the organization.=20 45.=09recruiting: disorganized, not enough student focus, trying to compete= with the ibanks but not willing to offer the salaries, sometimes unprofess= ional conduct (rejection letters to students contained spelling errors and = gave message 'you are not good enough'). 46.=09summer intern program: not well coordinated.=20 47.=09rotation length: keep flexibility. 6 mos sometimes too short (other t= imes too long); disincents management to include associates in longer term/= meatier projects. 48.=09when is the issue of salary increases going to be revisited? 49.=09overall, enron has a great group of people to work with. 50.=09enron has an excellent diversity of backgrounds, ethnicity, and natio= nalities within the company. 51.=09enron has an excellent overall atmosphere 52.=09overall, enron has an excellent overall company image 53.=09i do not have too many comments. my main problem with the last team w= as that they were extremely rigid - rigid start date, rigidity in assigning= groups, etc. old group did one-way dialogues, they would not even listen. = the new group appears flexible and is willing to listen - these are two thi= ngs i feel are most important in running such program. 54.=09three months ago i talked with althea gordon about a couple of friend= s that graduated with me from my business school. they wanted (still want)= to work for enron. i sent her their resumes and am still waiting for a res= ponse (i believe she left enron). i then contacted patricia payton. several= emails, phone calls and still haven't heard from her. it's frustrating dea= ling with the hr dept. 55.=09prc is not a trusted mechanism. few people in the program understand= it fully, no one knows exactly what occurs in the meetings, and no one bel= ieves the results are truly equitable. politics appears to play as much of= a role as performance, if not more so, in determining rankings. further, = groups are not obligated to tell people in the pool where they ultimately r= anked people. for as much as individuals' success depends upon this rankin= g, and for as open and honest as the process is supposed to be, that policy= is incredibly inconsistent. 56.=09we are under market for compensation - everyone knows this, regardles= s of what the program people say. it is common knowledge that at least rel= iant and el paso are paying their program participants more in salary and b= onus. the decision to increase sign on bonuses and not salaries to incomin= g participants slighted existing program members by keeping our salaries fl= at and was not well received (obviously). 57.=09rotation placement service is not very useful. the best way to find = a good rotation remains through networking. 58.=09the experience, talent, and character of the associate pool continue = to be excellent. 59.=09cooperation and support within the associate class is very good with = virtually no known instances of undermining or backstabbing. comeraderie a= mong the class is widespread and genuine. 60.=09the efforts to solicit feedback and foster communication by the new a= /a program administration is appreciated and a positive step in the right d= irection. 61.=09historically there has been at best a poor effort to both maintain in= ternal communication and networking within each associate class and to crea= te new networks between individual associate classes. efforts by individua= l associates to affect this have not been supported. 62.=09mixers with business unit management should be continuously offered, = particularly as rotation time approaches. this would facilitate informal d= iscussion about opportunities and business unit activity. additionally it = would be a good format for associates to exchange information on their rota= tions and introduce those interested to potential future managers. 63.=09compensation is clearly an issue. whether the compensation gap exist= s in reality or it only exists in perception, there is a widespread belief = that enron is under-compensating associates relative to both other firms in= the industry and to a broader set of companies where the same skill sets a= re employed. this is exasperated by the collapsing stock price and severel= y underwater options. base salary should be addressed. 64.=09again, whether perception or reality, associates are concerned about = selecting rotations in groups that are not making money. the belief is tha= t bonus levels rise and fall with the profitability of business units. the= refore, it is an extreme disincentive to rotate through an unprofitable gro= up, regardless of the skill development it may offer. 65.=09the mandatory eighteen-month service period before eligibility for pr= omotion is arbitrary and penalizes the best performers. 66.=09what happened to the a/a publication? 67.=09there is no source available that provides a history of individual as= sociates who have rotated through specific jobs. it would be very benefici= al to have a directory of associates who could be contacted for first-hand = information on business units of interest. 68.=09my assessment of the program thus far is that i think there are a lot= of instances where the interviewing group is not upfront about the respons= ibilities that they plan to assign to the associates before they get into t= he group. once in, i know of several people including myself that get a wh= ole lot of very ridiculous work that was not a part of the set expectations= prior to joining that group. furthermore, i believe that associates get w= ork that is more suitable for a clerk than for someone with a graduate degr= ee. this is very frustrating because once your in, your in and you can't g= et out for 6 months. on top of that, you get prc reviews based on work tha= t was not challenging and i do not believe that a fair and equitable assess= ment can be made. =20 69.=09now i understand that this line of thinking does not apply to everyon= e. but the point is that much of this would never happen if people were up= front with their expectations prior to hiring on an associate. in addition= , it bothers me that associates are many times treated very, very poorly by= their new groups. this has not been the case for me, but i know people th= at have voiced these thoughts and opinions - so i am speaking for them inca= se they are too nervous to put it into writing. 70.=09that is about it. i would like to see some education come out of the= associate program as to new groups that start within enron, as well as som= e greater insight to particular groups and the expectations. 71.=09when enron recruited us, it was so different from what it is now. so= many diverse opportunities were out there. now, enron is heading towards = a pure trading house. it is getting harder and harder to get a decent rota= tion out of trading. but you don't need an mba to be a trader! in fact, a= ssociates often work for analysts on the trading side, and we don't have an= y special attention or cultivation from management to progress on the tradi= ng side. it is not a surprise some of us are thinking about ""getting the n= ext rotation at el paso"". 72.=09a lot of business units think associates come and go too quickly, and= six months is not enough for us to climb up the learning curve first, and = then make meaningful contributions. some people think it is worthwhile to = groom associates, even less worthwhile than to cultivate analysts, who are = supposed to be there longer. it is sometimes difficult for associates to g= et meaningful assignments if management holds such a perception against us. 73.=09compensation level needs to be adjusted to match up with our competit= ors. 74.=09the company's direction has changed drastically from the one i interv= iewed for in november 2000, some of these strategies seem shortsighted and = in my opinion could make it more difficult for the company to compete in th= e energy business in the long term; specifically: 75.=09the stated strategy of exiting all generation, exploration, and trans= portation assets in my mind endangers the competitive position of the compa= ny and earns us a banking multiple on the street. also, with additional pl= ayers entering the gas and power markets in a major way, how can we expect = to continue to grow and maintain our current market share? 76.=09along with our success there have been many failed business ventures;= including azurix, enron international, dabhol, ebs, and ees. the failures= of ees and ebs have still not been fully resolved and appear to have not b= een totally priced in to our stock price. bottom line; there does not appe= ar to be any large areas of growth within the company. 77.=09pay! when the firms right up the street offers you anywhere from 25,0= 00 to 40,000 dollars more to do the same job; it doesn't make you feel very= intelligent to be working here. additionally, when i accepted this positi= on i was never told and have yet to be told what the official limits on and= what the determinants are of the annual bonus. what i have heard through = the grapevine is that it is significantly lower than what i was led to beli= eve during recruiting. not having any assistance and having attended a top= east coast school, i am almost $100,000 dollars in debt. i was counting o= n the annual bonus to allow me to remove this albatross from around my neck= , but in reality after my debt service i am barely better off than when i w= orked as an engineer in manufacturing. 78.=09i don't see much difference in the kind of assignments between analys= ts and associates. it seems unfair for analysts since they get lower salari= es, but it is also a waste of ""years of experience"" in the case of associat= es. it is probably the number of associates hired every year through the p= rogram gives the idea of a cheap resource for the business units. be certai= n the position requires some degree of expertise before assigning an associ= ate. 79.=09if you look at a/a as human capital, we at enron are very long in bac= kground, experience and knowledge. the a/a program is ""regulation"" using en= ron terminology: from rotation assignments, to payments. i see pretty logic= al the consequences: a lot of inefficiencies, waste of energy, the lack of = objectivity, poor motivation or even frustration, in general performance is= far away from excellent. add some flexibility to the program: let the peop= le choose their rotations and move without restrictions. let them also nego= tiate working conditions, salaries, and career path with the business unit. 80.=09prc is unfair. i consider offensive writing in a maximum of 5 lines 6= months of accomplishments. i don't think a prc committee can better assess= the performance than the business unit. 360-degree evaluations, and peers = review are ok. re-think the need of a committee and a ranking of a/a assig= ned to so different business units. 81.=09i feel free to choose for a second rotation. i like the way you can a= pproach a new business unit, introduce yourself, have an interview and gath= ered information about the business and your position. things may change af= ter that and you get stacked in that place for at least 6 months. keep allo= wing people to search and move freely from hr. 82.=09make staff more accountable. online based. much like the it departm= ent, where when i call it initiates a request that i must approval closure = of with any comments. 83.=09tell people up front that bonuses are pretty fixed until you make man= ager. not communicated at all. 84.=09tell people that their first rotations are assigned. also not commun= icated. 85.=09i wish i had a prc suggestion, but i need to think about it. 86.=09don't insult my intelligence by giving incoming associates more money= but putting it in a bonus so you don't have to give us raises. if you wan= t to do that, give me the courtesy of being up front about it. 87.=09some kind of database (maybe there is one that i don't know about) of= openings. would be pretty cool. 88.=09raise compensation so it is at a premium to our competitors - at the = least so it is equal. 89.=09make the development and support of associates a more important crite= rion in the prc process for both directors and vice presidents. the commer= cial stress is so high right now that development is ignored completely 90.=09reduce the size of each incoming class - make the program special aga= in. right now, i can't believe the broad spread in ability and experience = in the associate class. i guarantee the spread is not that high in other t= op tier firms that hire mbas. 91.=09with the smaller size, assign a lead commercial person to a group of = 5 associates. the lead commercial person (a director or vp) would keep in = touch with and help out his group of associates to make sure they make the = most of their rotations and enron gets the most out of them 92.=09make sure the program stays in touch with commercial groups so these = groups know when they need a clerk, analyst, or associate. too often we tr= eat analysts, clerks, and 30-year-old associates with 6-8 years of experien= ce the same. this happens way too much. 93.=09the program should work with the incoming associates a little closer = to help them understand what kinds of job or what kind of career path they = want to take and design a plan on how to get them there."

t=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=1335&> , te ind - free agent updated 10/18/01 pollard has emerged as indianpolis' top option at tight end. he will once again be a key factor in the passing game against new england this week, edgerrin james < rb ind - president taft updated 10/18/01 james was held to just 55 rushing yards in his first game against new england this year. expect much better numbers on james' home turf this week. reggie wayne < wr ind - orange roughy updated 10/18/01 wayne is expected to start ! in! place of the injured jerome pathon for the second consecutive week. wayne has not done much yet, so don't put him in your fantasy lineup. marvin harrison < wr ind - c-dawg's boyz updated 10/18/01 harrison suually performs well in divisional matchups, and has burned patriots cb ty law in the past. expect him to produce good numbers against new england. peyton manning < qb ind - orange roughy updated 10/18/01 manning did not perform well the first time he faced new england. he was intercepted by the patriots three times, but should perform better against them at home this week. randy moss < ge! tbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=12576&>, wr min - team chick updated 10/18/01 moss did not participate in practice wednesday due to his sore right ankle. he should be able to practice on thursday and play sunday against green bay, but hold off deciding on whether to use him until it's clear whether he will be able to play. bill schroeder < wr gb - grid iron goons updated 10/18/01 schroeder missed practice wednesday with an ankle injury. he is receiving treatment and should play sunday, but monitor his progress before deciding whether to use him this week. terry glenn < wr ne - free agent updated 1! 0/! 18/01 glenn might have another good game this week. indianapolis' secondary might have trouble handling glenn, who immediately proved an early-season layoff didn't hurt him last week. antowain smith < rb ne - team dick updated 10/18/01 smith rushed for 94 yards and two tds the first time he faced the colts this year. expect him to get in the end zone at least once this week, in his second meeting with indianapolis. wayne chrebet < wr nyj - dont mess updated 10/18/01 chrebet's numbers have been very disappointing so far. he could have a good we! ek! if the jets engage in a shootout with the rams. he is still a risky start, because new york will center its gameplan around curtis martin. laveranues coles < wr nyj - team dick updated 10/18/01 coles has emerged as a go-to receiver for the jets, but might be held down by the rams. the st. louis defenive backs should be able to match his downfield speed. curtis martin < rb nyj - grid iron goons updated 10/18/01 martin will be the focal point of the new york offense this week. the jets will try to control the ball and the clock against the rams. stephen davis < &k! ey=1440&>, rb was - houston big ballers updated 10/18/01 davis had his first decent game of the season on monday against dallas, but he's still a very risky fantasy player due to washington's horrible offense. facing carolina is an advantageous matchup, however, so starting davis this week warrants consideration. tony banks < qb was - free agent updated 10/18/01 banks was very mediocre against dallas on monday night, completing 10-of-18 passes for only 132 yards and one touchdown. at this point, banks isn't even worth a roster spot outside of deeper leagues. michael westbrook < wr was - c-dawg's boyz ! up! dated 10/18/01 westbrook has been less than mediocre this season, but he could have a decent outing against carolina. he's had some success against the panthers in the past, but he's still only worth starting in deeper leagues. vinny testaverde < qb nyj - uran man updated 10/18/01 testaverde might not be a good start this week. the st. louis defense can be opportunistic, and could very well make the jets qb throw his first interception of the year. walter rasby < te was - free agent updated 10/18/01 rasby will likely get most of the work at tight end ! no! w that stephen alexander is out. however, he warrants no real fantasy consideration at this point. rod gardner < wr was - houston big ballers updated 10/18/01 gardner could have a decent game against a questionable carolina secondary on monday. he's worth considering as a starter fantasy-wise, but only in larger leagues. torry holt < wr stl - president taft updated 10/18/01 holt has the potential to post big numbers against a shaky n.y. jets secondary on sunday. he's a big time fantasy wideout and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis. isaac bruce < t=! players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=1294&> , wr stl - uran man updated 10/18/01 bruce hasn't been very consistent thus far, but he's far too talented to ever consider benching. look for him to turn things around against the questionable n.y. jets secondary. ernie conwell < te stl - free agent updated 10/18/01 conwell has become a decent tight end from a fantasy perspective this season. he's worth staring on a weekly basis if you don't have a more reliable tight end on your roster. trung canidate < rb stl - blue balls updated 10/18/01 canidate will likely replace marshall faulk as st. louis' featured back this weekend against the n.y. jets. he has a good knowledge of the rams' offense and is easily worth starting this week from a fantasy perspective. kurt warner < qb stl - luccis losers updated 10/18/01 considering the huge numbers he puts up on a consistent basis, warner is a a must-start every week. he'll post another big game against the new york jets on sunday, so be sure to put him your lineup. correll buckhalter < rb phi - uran man updated 10/18/01 buckhalt! er! isn't expected to start, but don't be surprised if he gets the majority of the carries on monday night against the giants. coach andy reid will start duce staley in the backfield, but buckhalter will likely be the more productive of the two backs. donovan mcnabb < qb phi - team dick updated 10/18/01 mcnabb is one of the top fantasy players in the league, and is worth starting on a weekly basis. he should beat the giants for two scores and around 275 yards on monday night, so be sure to get him into your lineup. todd pinkston < wr phi - drock's beaatchs updated 10/18/01 pinkston is slowly becoming one of donovan mcnabb's favorite targets this season. he's worth starting against the giants, whose secondary is a bit suspect at this point. tyrone wheatley < 21! 5.fantasy.sportsline.com/mp/elink?script=players&league=getbad&owner=98084.5&random=3367&key=1140&>, rb oak - uran man updated 10/18/01 the contra-costa times says wheatley has sustained a sprained medial collateral ligament in his right knee. although some sources say wheatley will miss two to four weeks, jon gruden says wheatley is questionable for oct. 28, and is unaware of any prognosis beyond that. chad lewis < te phi - blue balls updated 10/18/01 lewis will have a good shot at producing some solid fantasy numbers on monday against the n.y. giants. he's one of the league's top tight ends and should be in your starting lineup on a weekly basis. more updates < ue!

"continuing our salute to the ets employees nominated for the 2000 chairman's award, please join me in congratulating: morris brassfield rick brown bob burleson gary choquette morris, senior director of supply management in houston, is responsible for 60-plus employees in a ten state area. during his employment, morris has been required to close, move and establish field offices throughout the united states. he has also been involved in reorganizing and developing new ets business units. morris is an important leader in ets. rick, a construction coordinator in amarillo, was instrumental in the kansas a-line abandonment project. he made sure affected landowners and the construction contractor were treated fairly. in one instance, he traveled several hundred miles to have a face-to-face discussion with a group of landowners to ensure that the project would be completed without adverse environmental impact. rick's effort diffused a potentially large and expensive problem. bob, an account director in houston, explains complex transactions and details about ecosystems with great ease. his prudent, careful and adept professional customer dealings are among the best. bob is a true asset to enron's customers and employees. gary, an engineering specialist in omaha, is always looking for a more efficient way of doing work. he has the initiative to drive change in the work process. often times this requires the software development of new tools. gary is dedicated in problem solving and working on a consensus for a solution. again, congratulations to morris, rick, bob and gary. stan"

"cc: bcc: alan: regarding the legal comments below: my impression was that the joe had settled the choice of law issue: i.e. the umbrella documents (password application and electronic trading agreement) will be identical to those used in north america containing a new york choice of law provision. these agreements have been approved by local counsel in japan. this is till my recommendation unless the commercial team decides that a document governed by japanese law is essential. as is the case for all enrononline trading, the online gtc's governing various commodities contain an appropriate choice of law for that product (e.g. english law for uk gas, new york law for us derivatives, etc.) regardless of where the counterparty is situated. when a japanese product is offered, i would assume that you will create a gtc governed by japanese law, but last i heard that bridge is still ahead of us. i don't know what the ""international contracts"" are that rousseau refers to. there is no standard agreement for online trading. the eta provides that if a counterparty and the relevant enron entity have a master agreement in place (such as an isda master agreement for derivatives trading [is this what rousseau had in mind?]) such master will control the relevant transactions. the choice of law in that master would be the subject of negotiation at the time the master was signed. in summary, unless the commercial team has changed its mind on the documents, the legal side of things is ready to go. mark alan aronowitz 04/03/2000 11:52 am cc: mark john rousseau i have copied mark taylor on this note and asked him to call me to discuss. we will update you and rousseau as we learn more from the enron online people. alan joseph p 04/03/2000 12:48 am cc: alan, pls look into the legal comments made below. joe ---------------------- forwarded by joseph p hirl/enron_development on 04/03/2000 04:48 pm --------------------------- rousseau anai 04/03/2000 04:43 pm cc: joseph p hi john i was wondering whether you could clarify the following additional issues: * legal i'm not comfortable that the legal/contract situation is being sorted out. mario mentioned that there is still some debate as to whether the contracts should be under japanese or us law etc... this was something that they were debating about 3 weeks ago. my understanding was that international contracts would be used. these are contracts that trading houses and investment banks would already be familiar with. could you clarify the exact nature of the hold-up and get a date by which they will finalise this issue. the name of the legal guy is mark taylor. i'd like to contact him directly some time to make sure everything is progressing as planned (after all, if we don't have the contracts ready, noone can trade) * help desk it is not a good idea to totally rely on the houston help desk for eol (especially during japanese business hours). it took them about 4 minutes to get a translator. using the translator was time consuming (also remember, international call), the translator was quite rude....and, in any case, i agree that there should be some support on the ground (demonstrate enron commitment to japan) please feel free to give me a call. i'm at the okura on +81 3 3582 0111 cc: rousseau joe, after extensive probing i discovered that the marketing materials eol has planned cannot be delivered in time for our plans. i can think of a number of alternatives for addressing this problem, including: changing brochures to one that can be more easily produced, changing printing firms and/or locations, and delaying the launch date until the following week. at least one person at eol suggested that we have a ""press conference"" on may 10 and then send out the materials. i do not think this is an acceptable approach because it wastes the opportunities from the nikkei interview on april 10, the higher profile mcdonald/hirl interviews during last week of april and buzz from counterparties receiving the packet. there appears to be a pervasive misunderstanding of our strategy and timelines. to correct this, i have asked for a meeting with all of the interested parties (except louise) on monday afternoon. we will walk through every step of the marketing plan and ensure that we have buy-in and accountable parties for the parts of the process that are outside of the control of enron japan. after the meeting, i will let you know where we stand and what we can reasonably expect. if we cannot resolve everything, i'll confer with you before taking it up with louise. john ps please note the following exchange. please let me know if you want for me to soften my position. ---------------------- forwarded by john ambler/enron_development on 03/31/2000 10:21 pm --------------------------- enron international cc: mario parra kal dave, i understand that the meeting has been set for 2:00 p.m. on monday in your office. i look forward to our getting together to nail down the details while there is still an opportunity to make necessary adjustments. on the subject of cover letters, there are several reasons for our approach: given the urgency of completing the necessary pieces of the mailing, it is more expedient to include two letters than to go through approvals on a new joint letter. we want our counterparties to understand that there are two avenues of communication into enron - enrononline (initially in english) for its e-commerce platform and enron japan for a host of japan specific business lines. it is important that we position them as separate but complementary. it's very easy for people in this market to confuse multifaceted business interests. to be effective, we need to direct them to the appropriate sources/authorities. at this point enrononline will only be available in english, so potential users would need to be able to read your letter in english anyway. however, in following japanese protocols, many of the packets will need to be sent to higher level officials, who would then pass the packet on to the end users. these are the people that we need to notify of enron's tokyo office and that enrononline is one of the many products and services available through enron. it is essential that this higher audience have the name of just the top enron official in japan, otherwise they may think that they should bypass the enron japan office and always go to houston. (in this culture it is a real risk.) this would jeopardize enron's strategy for japan. i hope the above mentioned considerations are helpful. i look forward to discussing this further when we meet monday. john david 03/31/2000 07:11 pm cc: mario parra kal john, it seems strange to me that we will not be translating the cover letter. this would mean that the cover letter is the only thing in the envelope which is not in japanese? also, i'm wondering why we would have two cover letters. would it not be better to combine the messages into one? perhaps we can discuss on monday - i understand a conference call with the recipients of this email is being set up. dave cc: david kal mario, we sent the translation to kal yesterday afternoon, japan time. the cover letter is fine with us (we don't plan to translate it, since users can read english). we plan to add another cover letter in japanese from hirl as well. if, in addition to kal, you need the translation too, please let me know. i'll be back in the us next week if we need to discuss (i'll be calling kal to ask about printing delivery dates). thanks, john mario parra 03/31/2000 03:32 pm cc: david john, we were checking today the launch process for eol in japan. could you please let us know the status of the press release and the translation of the ""getting started"", the ball brochure and the cover letter? is there an expected date for the completion of the translation? thanks in advance, mario"

"fyi metropolitan desk; section b metro business internet utility plans move to westchester by joseph p. fried 09/21/2000 the new york times page 11, column 5 c. 2000 new york times company the new power company, an internet utility, is planning to establish its headquarters in purchase, n.y., state and westchester county officials said yesterday. new power was formed in may by the houston energy giant enron to work with america online and i.b.m. to sell electricity and natural gas to homes and small businesses over the internet. it has been temporarily located in greenwich, conn. in return for its commitment to create 400 new jobs at its future headquarters and invest $7 million in renovating and outfitting 80,000 square feet at a purchase office complex, new power is eligible to apply for hundreds of thousands of dollars in energy discounts and tax exemptions from state and county agencies. joseph p. fried (nyt) copyright , 2000 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. business; financial desk markets drillers seek new natural gas sites 09/21/2000 los angeles times home edition page c-4 copyright 2000 / the times mirror company natural gas drillers are turning up the heat on uncle sam to open up more areas for exploration, amid the highest gas prices ever. anadarko petroleum corp. said wednesday it plans to start drilling for natural gas in two parts of the arctic by early 2002, in hopes that a gas pipeline to the lower 48 states will be built by 2008. the company last month bought the right to explore 176,000 acres in the mackenzie delta of the canadian arctic. it will begin seismic shooting, which maps the geology of potential drilling sites, this winter in both the delta and alaska's north slope, said john seitz, president and chief operating officer. natural gas prices in the last decade haven't been high enough to justify the expense of building a gas pipeline from alaska, major oil companies have said. but with prices having doubled this year, interest in building a line has been renewed. gas futures on the new york mercantile exchange fell 4.5 cents to $5.318 per million british thermal units wednesday, down just slightly from tuesday's record. ""the country needs gas from the arctic,"" seitz said, speaking at the dain rauscher wessels oil and gas conference in houston. about a dozen companies have pipeline proposals on the table, seitz said. he estimated that at least one route could be built by 2008. some estimates are for as early at 2005, he said. drilling on both anadarko's mackenzie and north slope properties could begin in december 2001 or january 2002, seitz said. but chances for construction of a gas pipeline could be threatened if the government intervenes to push down prices, experts say. ""we've got an election year, so anything's up for grabs,"" said lisa stewart, executive vice president of business development for oil and gas explorer apache corp. another energy giant, gas producer and energy trader enron corp., also warned against government intervention. ""markets do correct, and this market also will correct,"" enron ceo kenneth lay said at the governors' natural gas summit in columbus, ohio. ""as long as the regulators will leave it alone . . . this market will come back into balance in the next two or three years."" without government interference, apache thinks prices will remain appealing enough to spur new drilling. stewart noted that gas inventories are low nationwide and demand is expected to boom. the government will probably move or be pressured to open up lands now off limits to explorers, rather than impose price controls, seitz said. california and the rocky mountains are ripe for exploration, he said. ""the solution for the prices is more supply, and we need to have more land to explore and exploit,"" he said. shares of both anadarko and apache rose wednesday, even as many other energy stocks fell. anadarko (ticker symbol: apc) gained 95 cents to $64; apache rose 19 cents to $62.69. both trade on the new york stock exchange. enron (ene), one of the hottest energy stocks, fell $2.69 to $82.17 on the new york stock exchange.

(this article was originally published wednesday) houston -(dow jones)- the competitive natural gas market can deliver reliable service and help consumers reduce exposure to rising gas prices, enron corp. (ene) chairman and chief executive officer kenneth lay said wednesday in ohio. using a number of slide graphics, lay spoke at wednesday's natural gas summit in columbus, ohio, convened by alaska gov. tony knowles and ohio gov. bob taft. lay warned against overreacting to the recent run-up in prices and urged officials to encourage utilities to take advantage of price hedging opportunities to protect consumers against price volatility. lay said the nymex natural gas futures board shows gas prices, although at a peak $5.495 per million british thermal units, declining to $3.345/mmbtu by september 2003. ""the gas resource base remains robust and today's prices will self-correct over time,"" lay said. overall, he said, the market has delivered more than $174 billion in savings to consumers since the market opened to competition in 1984. lay said those utilities that haven't protected their customers against rising prices this winter will pay less per unit of gas than they did in the early 1980s. the enron chairman, a close friend of republican texas gov. george w. bush, also urged government officials to consider lifting access restrictions to develop new gas supplies to meet growing electricity generation demand from the growing digital economy. federal statutes restrict production drilling in the u.s. eastern seaboard, the gulf coast of florida and california, and the rockies, lay said.. about 400 people attended the one-day conference wednesday, sponsored by the interstate oil and gas compact commission (iogcc). also offering presentations were dr. fausto alzati araiza, mexican president-elect vicente fox's energy advisor and nick schultz, vice president of regulatory and transportation policy for the canadian association of petroleum producers. daniel yergin, chairman of cambridge energy research associates, also urged a ""continent-wide"" response by industry and government to address the current natural gas price shock and meet long-term energy needs. the price shock means most u.s. utilities anticipate an increase of between 20%-40% in residential heating bills this winter while industrial customers will be hit even harder - as much as 50%-100% increases in energy costs, yergin said. -by john edmiston, dow jones newswires, ; copyright , 2000 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. report on business: technology at work web consultants feel dot-com pain failure of many internet startups causes plunge in consulting revenue douglas a. blackmon and ann carrns wall street journal 09/21/2000 the globe and mail metro t6 all material copyright thomson canada limited or its licensors. all rights reserved. a big dose of reality is sinking in for the web's professional gurus. after months of defying the gravitational pull of imploding dot-coms, revenues are plunging at some internet consulting firms as big companies shift their investment strategies for web technology. investors have reacted by letting the air out of a slew of once high-flying stocks. one of the fastest-growing consultancies, ixl enterprises inc., announced the layoff of 350 workers less than a week after the resignation of its president and an announcement that revenue in the current quarter will be as much as 20 per cent lower than expected. meanwhile, there were signs that an earlier generation of consulting firms was trying to move in for the kill, mounting raids to steal talented young web experts from the battered firms. deloitte consulting was the most brazen, taking out a full-page ad in the wall street journal urging employees of web firms to jump ship. the extent and precise nature of the web consulting fallout isn't clear. ixl, viant corp. and xpedior inc., each of which have issued warnings of lower-than-anticipated third-quarter revenues, maintain that large firms are slowing spending as they feel less pressure from internet start-ups. ""in june and july, the global 1,000 companies started looking around and saying, 'holy cow, these dot-coms aren't around anymore, nipping at my heels . . . i'm going to take more time to make these decisions,' "" said william nussey in an interview after he resigned as president of ixl. but senior executives at major corporations say that while the climate and pace may have changed, they are still investing heavily in the internet. bank of america, for instance, announced in july that it plans to spend $70-million (u.s.) on electronic commerce initiatives over the coming six months. kevin koertje, marketing director at boise cascade corp.'s office-products unit, which generates hundreds of millions in on-line sales, said the company ""is pouring a tonne more money"" into web systems. but much of that is going to older firms with expertise in legacy computer systems, such as kpmg consulting, and to narrowly specialized technology experts. indeed, the biggest shift in web consulting may be simply that some customers are no longer convinced they want outside help in developing on-line strategies. xpedior, for instance, said sears roebuck & co., which is building up its in-house web expertise, has reduced its use of the consulting firm's services this year. analysts say investors must differentiate between firms with true strategic expertise to sell and those that are merely proficient at setting up web sites. mayank tandon, an analyst with janney montgomery scott, said firms with true ""intellectual capital"" will be the ones to succeed, citing chicago consultant diamond technology partners inc., which works closely with goldman sachs group inc. and enron corp. raul fernandez, chief executive officer of proxicom inc. of reston, va., said his firm is on track to meet revenue projections. copyright , 2000 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. colorado utility plans to build a power plant near colorado springs rich laden 09/21/2000 krtbn knight-ridder tribune business news: the gazette - colorado springs, colorado copyright (c) 2000 krtbn knight ridder tribune business news; source: world reporter (tm) an arm of energy giant enron corp. will build a $100 million power plant south of colorado springs to sell electricity to the former public service co. of colorado, which wants to add generating capacity around the state. the plant, to consist of four natural gas-powered turbines generating 215 megawatts, will be built near an existing electric substation, west of interstate 25 and about six miles south of colorado springs utilities' ray nixon power plant. denver-based xcel energy inc., formerly public service, serves denver, northern colorado and other areas outside of colorado springs. it plans to spend $1.55 billioncq to upgrade its power-generation and transmission capacity around the state. the goal is to have enough new power for 1.6 million households beyond the 2.5 million customers xcel energy now serves. earlier this year, xcel sought proposals from companies interested in meeting its projected power needs. enron north america corp., a subsidiary of houston-based enron, an electric, gas and communications powerhouse, was one of nine successful bidders responding to xcel's request for proposals. those nine bidders will help supply about 1,500 megawatts of generating capacity around colorado. another successful bidder, wilexco inc. of englewood, also was chosen by xcel, and plans to build an 83-megawatt plant south of the planned enron facility at a cost of more than $90 million. it will burn tires to generate its power although the facility still needs to clear various local and state regulatory hurdles. enron should complete its facility by june, said eric thode, director of public relations for enron north america corp. wilexco's plant is targeted for operation by 2003, said company owner brian wilde. xcel spokeswoman jessica anderson said her company has a 10-year deal with enron to buy power. wilde said his deal with xcel is for 15 years. ""the people who live and work here in colorado need this additional generation,"" anderson said. at the end of those initial contracts, enron and wilexco could sell power to other users. the opportunity for such deals might be enhanced if colorado deregulates its electric industry and opens it up to competition. until now, state lawmakers have rejected deregulation efforts. still, anderson said, the addition of the power plants helps position the state for the time when deregulation takes place. xcel, as public service, supported deregulation legislation in the general assembly. wilde, of wilexco, said selling electricity in a deregulated market wasn't the reason his firm sought to build its plant because he doesn't know what the electric industry will be like in 15 years. thode echoed that sentiment, saying, ""this plant is being built for the deal as it currently exists. this deal makes sense because this deal makes sense, period."" colorado springs utilities also is adding generating capacity. two 30-megawatt, gas-fired turbines have been added to the nixon plant, which burns coal to generate its power. copyright , 2000 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. houston chronicle thursday, september 21 business briefs koch forms unit to trade bandwidth wichita, kan. -- closely held koch industries, one of the world's largest energy traders, said it has formed a unit to trade bandwidth, or spare capacity on fiber-optic cables. koch global bandwidth services will be led by bill mohl, who has held several senior management jobs at koch for the past five years. he also was vice president at altra energy technologies. the unit will be based in houston. koch industries, based in wichita, joins companies such as houston-based enron corp. and tulsa-based williams cos. that have diversified into trading bandwidth from their pipeline business. enron plans to spend as much as $1.95 billion over the next two to three years to expand its fiber-optic network and broadband-trading operations, chief executive ken lay said wednesday in houston. usa: profit-taking hits enron stock. 09/20/2000 reuters english news service (c) reuters limited 2000. houston, sept 20 (reuters) - energy marketer enron corp. saw its stock fall sharply for a second day wednesday, a move analysts attributed to profit-taking after a strong run for the shares since early july. enron closed $2-11/16 lower at $82-3/16 on the new york stock exchange wednesday after losing $5-9/16 tuesday, making a total decline of slightly more than 9 percent over both days. analysts noted the decline followed a strong performance by the stock, which broke above a mid-$60s to mid-$70s trading range in august to hit a 52-week high of $90-9/16 on aug. 23, more than doubling its end-1999 value of $44-6/16. ""inevitably you are going to get some profit-taking as we get near the end of the quarter and people want to lock in some of their profits,"" said merrill lynch analyst donato eassey. ed tirello of deutsche banc alex brown said the decline was due in part to investors viewing enron as a technology play, because of its online trading and broadband businesses. consequently enron's stock was susceptible to weakness in the tech-heavy nasdaq market this month, which appeared to have triggered selling by momentum investors, tirello said. merrill lynch's eassey said enron's stock might also have been hurt by an article in the weekly texas supplement to the wall street journal, which called into question the trading profits reported by enron and other big energy marketers. eassey dismissed the article as ""misleading"" and said he retained a buy rating on enron's stock with a 12 month-price target of $95. ""this is a stock that you've got to have in your core portfolio. enron is still one of the premier companies that you can own in all of the market,"" he said. however, investing in enron was not without risks and amounted to betting on the company's ability to execute successfully on new technology opportunities, he added. copyright , 2000 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved."

"amy garland 5519 sw multnomah blvd portland, or 97219 to mr. ken lay, i'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as enron employee transition fund and reach, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in california, who can't afford to pay their energy bills. enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of california consumers and from the efforts of your employees. indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out. and enron made an astronomical profit during the california energy crisis last year. as a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt. the new york times reported that you sold $101 million worth of enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it. please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those americans hurt by enron's underhanded dealings. sincerely, amy garland"

""we've talked to the line about being more physical and we've talked to the backs about running tougher, and we'll continue to work on that,"" he said. the lack of a consistent running game hurt the horns at the end of last season, and brown and offensive coordinator greg davis said they want to have a more balanced offense this season. while hodges mitchell is clearly the no. 1 tailback, speedster victor ike seems to be laying claim to the no. 2 spot behind him. ike has beefed up to about 200 pounds without losing any of his great speed, and he he has been doing a good job of blocking and hanging on to the ball, two areas that have posed problems for him in the past. brown, meanwhile, isn't giving any hints about who he will start at quarterback on sept. 9. he had seemed to be leaning toward sophomore chris simms, in the wake of off-season knee surgery for all-big 12 qb major applewhite. but then he started saying applewhite seems to be completely recovered from the knee injury. he could have started simms and blamed it on applewhite's suspect knee, but now that he says the knee is no longer suspect, i frankly don't know what to think. my gut feeling is that it will be applewhite, but i sure wouldn't bet any money on it. tuesday's 8 a.m. and 5 p.m. practices will wrap up two-a-day practices. school starts wednesday and the last public workout will be a 6 p.m. scrimmage wednesday at royal memorial stadium. brown said the players will be given friday, saturday and sunday off, then will return monday to start getting ready for the season opener sept. 9 against louisiana-lafayette. ""we think it takes them two or three days to get their legs back, so we always give them three days off just before the first game week of the season,"" he said. * * * * fifth-year senior wr brandon healy made several outstanding catches monday, and brown said he is ""the most consistent guy we have at wide receiver right now."" but true freshmen roy williams and b. j. johnson continue to be impressive every day. they catch the long balls, the short balls and the in-between balls, and they have outstanding speed. * * * * defensive coordinator carl reese said cornerbacks quentin jammer and roderick babers are playing well. he also said he is serious about playing more people this year. ""we have a lot more depth on defense than we have had in our other two seasons here,"" he said. * * * * injury up lg derrick dockery has an infected cyst. he said both players will be held out of wednesday's scrimmage, but should be able to resume practicing next week. he also said cb ervis hill's sore knee will keep him out of practice until next week. backup dt ryan haywood has a sore shoulder, but might return to workouts tuesday, brown said. * * * * recruiting notes: mike crowe, head coach at corpus christi flour bluff, has a new junior middle linebacker who drew rave reviews in pittsburgh, pa., last year as a sophomore before his family moved to texas. the budding star is andy matakis, 6-3, 220, and fast. he ran a 4.4 40 at a camp in pittsburgh in may. crowe said matakis ""is a big kid who can really run. we're going to play him at middle linebacker and we'll probably try him at running back, too."" a story in the pittsburgh post-gazette last month said penn state and ohio state had offered matakis scholarships before he moved to texas. . . the longhorns still have 13 commitments, and they have an outside chance to get no. 14 when de eric hall of clarksville, tenn., takes his official visit the sept. 9 weekend. * * * * my next fax will be whenever events warrant. * * * * the true orange fax service includes at least 99 faxes a year and costs $99 ($79 by e-mail). the true orange newsletter includes 26 newsletters and is published weekly during football season and twice monthly during most of the other months. it costs $45. save by subscribing to both for $130 (or $110 if you take the faxes via e-mail or $99 if you take the faxes and newsletter via e-mail). send check to address at the top of page. i also update my 900 number - 1- - frequently with recruiting news. my e-mail address is:"

"attached below is a brochure regarding an upcoming national symposium - the reorganizing energy industry: shifting risks and opportunities to take place in madison, wisconsin november 29 and 30, 2000. i am pleased to be moderating this panel. given your role in this important industry, i believe that there are good reasons why you will want to attend. the event is sponsored by the wisconsin public utility institute, the federal energy bar association and the energy & telecommunications section of the wisconsin bar and will involve nationally prominent industry representatives as members of the faculty. the meeting will include leading wall street investment bankers, numerous regulatory commissioners from a variety of influential jurisdictions, experts ready to discuss implications of recent seismic events in the energy markets, and financial analysts and credit agencies who must evaluate the business strategies of energy companies to meet this unfolding future, and leading market participants. because the energy industry remains highly regulated, it remains a market which can be affected dramatically by a small number of people - not just through their use of capital in the market, but by their influence upon the policy makers who are now setting, and will continue to set, the rules. the symposium has been designed to provide an intimate forum for the exposition and discussion of energy industry policy among a mix of people who will influence the unfolding energy markets. obviously, you and your organization need to play a leading role in these discussions and i sincerely hope you can participate. <<symposium.pdf>> sandy williams - symposium.pdf"

"thanks for the update. any suggestions on anyone we might retain if this becomes a big ""government to government"" issue? john 01/26/2001 03:00 pm cc: steve with regard to dabhol, tom briggs and i have already provided a status briefing on the dabhol situation to agencies across the government - including doenergy, docommerce,dostate and dotreasury. the briefing was with staff and brought them up to speed on where we stand. as the new administration moves into the positions relevant to the situation we will brief them - all the way up to the cabinet officals. i understand that colin powell has already been briefed on the situation and i know the ambasssador has been front and center on the issue. if we were to move into a crisis mode, we will need to brief senior officals of the new administration at each of the above agencies as well as the vp's office. given their interest i think we will be able to do that quickly. we have also briefed opic and exim about the situation - they are comfortable at this point. i am also getting the world bank re-engaged to the extent that it is helpful and not a problem. they have resources that can help mseb reform themselves if mseb will view it has a help. it is a sensitive issue because the bank has historically been anti-dabhol so i am taking it step by step. if you have any other questions just let me know. thanks john"

"do we have someone who works for us now who was at transredes when the government owned it and could help us do a comparison between our respective environmental records? it seems to me that even though we are having our share of problems, we have probably had fewer problems than the government did and have probably been more responsive and thorough in our clean up efforts. obviously, we would need to be judicious about how we used such information (we don't want to aggravate the government), but having such an analysis may be helpful in showing the progress made and in discouraging overly punitive action by the government. what do you think?"

"cc: bcc: today, i worked with robin gibbs and jeff alexander on an enron pleading in the captioned case. i asked if we had considered asking ferc staff to file a ""friend of the court"" brief detailing how ferc has ""occupied the field"" of wholesale rate regulation. was this or should this be considered?"
"cc: bcc: rick: unfortunately, the stand alone reliability legislation does have a ""reasonable chance of passing."" to block this possibility, we are pursuing two strategies simultaneously. #1 the stakeholder letter with the message that the bill does little for reliability and provides no real political inoculation so should not be passed; and #2 the lack of consensus on the technical language contained within the bill makes passage problematic. if the bill were to be able to move, the bill must be considered ""consensus"" otherwise it will pose political problems for the calendar. today, there is still lack of bill consensus. we should consider a strategy of asking for reasonable legislative provisions beyond the current language which would improve the bill (and continue to keep true consensus from occurring.) of course, we cannot be obvious on this approach. part of the reason i was pushing to get one or our ceo's to play golf with congressman tauzin on the 22nd is he is the key member pushing the house leadership to pass the stand-alone bill now to ""politically inoculate republicans."" as the likely new house commerce committee chairman; he carries sway. another approach would be for us to call entergy to give congressman tauzin the same message. and our #3 strategy.....pray that the temperature cools down so the issue dissipates.....and/or they run out of time...... richard 08/10/2000 09:16 am cc: why are we communicating technical problems ?( do we think it has a reasonable chance of passing?) reliability-only legislation is bad policy. i cynthia 08/09/2000 07:09 pm mark joe sarah tom allison cc: as discussed, should congress upon its return after the labor day recess appear ready to move h.r. 4941, congressman wynn's stand-alone reliability legislation; a large group of stakeholders would sign and send the attached letter. although enron would like the letter to be stronger, this letter went through many revisions to reach the consensus language necessary for a larger group to sign. thus, while not a perfect letter, it would send a stronger message with a multitude of signatures. the status of the letter is that it is being ""held in our back pocket"" should it become necessary. pre-approval has been given and it stands in an ""almost"" final form. should you have any grave problems with the letter, let me know, and i will see what's possible given the constraints posed by the group. on a separate but related note, we are working with joe and dan to prepare a short white paper to detail the ""technical problems"" still remaining with the wynn legislative language and will communicate these problems, enron's opposition and lack of bill ""consensus"" to the hill shortly (as soon as this paper is ready.) i believe elcon, epsa and cma will continue to share our opposition although confusion remains on the hill as to the exact reasons for our opposition given the numerous versions of the legislation circulating. thanks. - 08_04_00_draft_stake_ltr_wjl.doc"

"they all have it now. i thought you would enjoy this one. did you hear about the protest in enron's chicago office. 40 acorn members stormed in, demanding that gregg penman fax a letter to ken lay. no kidding. ckm cc: how about forward ing this article to legal / finance / accounting, with the theme being that our pompano site on a relative basis is a cake walk. i'd like to see duke's financial model... -----original message----- sent: thu 5/24/2001 1:19 pm barbara cc: duke energy, environmentalists strike deal over california plant tom knudson may. 16, 2001 knight ridder tribune business news - krtbn copyright (c) 2001 krtbn knight ridder tribune business news; source: world reporter (tm) days after state regulators gave duke energy the go-ahead to expand its moss landing power plant near monterey bay last fall, documents show four environmental groups made their own deal with the utility giant. the four signed an agreement not to ""participate in any lawsuit (or) regulatory challenge"" that might slow or stop the project in exchange for a financial concession: $1 million from duke for environmental ""monitoring and research."" balancing power generation and environmental protection always has been difficult. but today, as power-starved california scrambles to find and permit new energy sources, some fear the moss landing agreement shows that money can sway even environmentalists -- and tip the scales too far in favor of economic development. environmentalists who signed the agreement, though, said that despite their concerns about the plant expansion, they had little chance of stopping it, especially after it was approved by the california energy commission and central coast regional water quality control board. so they took the potentially controversial step: entering into an agreement with duke for financial resources to pay for studies of the plant's impact on the marine environment. other environmentalists, though, criticized that approach. duke energy's efforts to modernize the moss landing power plant resulted in mitigation payments to environmental and other groups, including: $7 million to the elkhorn slough foundation to mitigate the plant's use of seawater. $425,000 to the monterey bay sanctuary foundation over three years to monitor heated seawater discharge in the ocean. $1 million to the monterey bay sanctuary foundation over five years to monitor water quality through a program sponsored by save our shores, the center for marine conservation, the friends of the sea otter and the otter project. $100,000 to the marine mammal center to relocate its triage center for injured animals onto power plant property. $3.4 million to the moss landing chamber of commerce over 20 years for infrastructure improvements in the moss landing community. $100,000 to design and construct a boardwalk for additional beach access in moss landing. $60,000 for an environmental assessment for a proposed elkhorn slough circle trail. if approved, duke would provide an additional $250,000 endowment to maintain the trail. ""it is very disheartening,"" said carolyn nielson, a retired teacher who along with some other local residents is waging a battle against what they consider an environmentally harmful power plant cooling system. ""these environmental groups have the expertise, the biologists, the attorneys,"" said nielson, who has taken her case to the state water resources control board. ""we could have been much more successful with their help. but there wouldn't have been any financial reward in it for them."" such criticisms are off-base, according to warner chabot, regional director for the center for marine conservation, a national environmental group that was among those to sign the deal. he said environmentalists got the best deal possible in the current energy climate. ""look at what's happening with power plant approvals in california right now,"" said chabot, referring to the state's push to bring new energy sources on line. the moss landing project -- which is scheduled to add 1,060 megawatts in 2002, enough to serve one million homes -- is a key part of that energy expansion plan. no money will go to the four environmental groups -- the center for marine conservation, along with save our shores, friends of the sea otter and the otter project. it will be routed, in five yearly installments of $200,000 each, to the monterey bay sanctuary foundation, a nonprofit organization that helps support sanctuary programs, including scientific research. chabot helped found the sanctuary foundation and sits on its board. he said the money will be used to monitor the health of elkhorn slough, a biologically rich estuary that borders the plant and is linked to monterey bay. ""not a dime comes to the center for marine conservation,"" he said. ""not a penny comes to me."" duke representatives said the controversy about the arrangement has been stirred by a handful of people. ""it's a million dollars worth of water quality studies,"" said duke spokesman tom williams. ""our whole effort wasn't to try to buy anybody off. it was designed to help increase people's comfort level where there wasn't a comfort level."" the $1 million agreement signed in november is part of a package of more than $12 million in duke payments to civil, government and environmental groups in connection with the plant modernization. the heftiest award -- $7 million to the elkhorn slough foundation, a nonprofit environmental organization -- was negotiated by state agencies to ""mitigate"" environmental impacts of the plant. formed in 1982, the slough foundation exists to promote ""the wise use and conservation of elkhorn slough and surrounding wetlands,"" its web site says. however, some environmentalists say the state-approved mitigation plan is inadequate. ""if you want to say, 'who did duke roll with a big chunk of money?' i would say they rolled the california energy commission and the regional water board for the price of mitigation,"" chabot said. ""the agencies got bought off cheap. and the environment got taken to the cleaners."" duke's williams strongly disagreed. environmental mitigation ""must be based on science, not on buying anybody off,"" he said. ""that is inappropriate, and we would not participate in that. ""that suggestion is offensive to us. and it should be offensive to any environmentalist."" bob haussler, head of the energy commission's environmental protection office, said the mitigation plan is biologically sound. ""we are confident it will improve the slough ecosystem,"" he said. madeline clark, a local businesswoman and founder of monterey parkway -- a citizens group that scrutinizes local public works projects -- called the recipients of duke's payments a ""shopping list"" of government agencies, environmental groups and civic organizations. she was particularly critical of the $1 million deal with environmental groups. ""you know what bothers me?"" clark said. ""environmental groups get tons of donations. their purpose is to protect and defend the environment. if a big corporation like duke can come in and buy them off, i have a real problem with that."" construction began in november on duke's project to add 1,060 megawatts of natural gas-fired electrical capacity to the moss landing plant, purchased from pg&e in 1998. if the expansion is finished next year, as scheduled, it would account for more than 30 percent of all new generation in california in 2002. ""this is a big deal,"" said williams, the duke spokesman. ""it will be the largest plant in california. if that plant is delayed a month or two, we lose the summer of 2002. and that affects not only duke energy, but the state of california."" opponents say it's not the power they oppose, but the plant's cooling system, which will pump about 1.2 billion gallons of seawater each day from moss landing harbor. such pumping, they say, will degrade elkhorn slough. they argue for an alternative cooling system, such as towers that re-circulate water. ""basically, what that plant will do is take 25 percent of the volume of the harbor and slough, run it through a pipe and dump it back into the ocean with much of the marine life cooked and dead,"" said steve shimek, executive director of the otter project. for shimek and other environmentalists, scientific studies commissioned by duke during the permitting process left key questions unanswered about the plant's impact on the environment. ""there was no scientific evidence that would literally point to duke causing harm to the environment,"" said vicki nichols, executive director of save our shores. ""we felt we didn't have strong standing to sue."" instead, the environmentalists began negotiating with duke for financial payments for studies of environmental impacts of the modernization project. the process ""gave me tremendous pause and great concern,"" nichols said. ""i knew there was going to be some perception that we were doing the wrong thing."" she was right. ""as far as i'm concerned, with the price-gouging going on by the energy wholesalers, they are just receiving stolen goods,"" said clark, of the citizens group. her skepticism was sharpened by the recent disclosure that duke energy approached gov. gray davis with a secret deal offering financial concessions if the state dropped lawsuits and investigations into the power generator. chabot, with the center for marine conservation, discouraged any comparison between the two offers, calling it ""grossly unfair and inaccurate."" regardless of what was intended with the payments, nielson said they stain the process. ""it is so destructive in terms of making everyone cynical,"" she said. shimek took a different view. ""we convinced duke to spend $1 million toward monitoring that, frankly, five years from now could very well come back to haunt them,"" he said. ""did we do the right thing? i have no idea. did we try our best? yes, we did."""

"----- forwarded by mark palmer/corp/enron on 07/10/2001 07:47 pm ----- ""leopold, jason"" 07/10/2001 07:32 pm cc: =dj ladwp, run by davis adviser, cashed in on calif crisis dow jones capital markets report via dow jones by jason leopold of dow jones newswires los angeles (dow jones)--on a single day in june 2000, the los angeles department of water and power, the largest municipal utility in the country, raked in $5 million selling california surplus power for $1,000 a megawatt-hour - about 30 times the average price the utility charged the month before. that sale, reported by the california independent system operator and confirmed by the ladwp in an interview last june, was one of many instances in which the municipal utility cashed in on california's power crisis. on monday, the department of water resources, the agency that has been purchasing california's bulk power needs in lieu of the state's cash-strapped utilities, released a detailed report of spot-market power purchases showing the ladwp charged the state an average of $242 a megawatt-hour for power from jan. 18 through may 31 this year. that price is about $35 higher than those charged by most of the out-of-state generators gov. gray davis has criticized repeatedly as price gougers. potentially embarrassing for the davis administration, however, is that the ladwp was formerly run by general manager david freeman, who in april became davis' top energy adviser. steve maviglio, press secretary to davis, said texas-based generators are primarily to blame for the high wholesale prices that crippled the state's two largest utilities. ""anywhere they wear cowboy hats, they probably have handkerchiefs across their face, because they are robbing us blind,"" he said. ""the bad guys are clearly the out-of-state generators."" freeman's trademark is a white stetson. the former ladwp chief, who last september quipped that a ""blind pig could make money"" under california's faulty deregulation setup, didn't return calls for comment. freeman took a leave of absence from the ladwp in january to negotiate long-term power contracts on behalf of the state. power to sell according to the dwr report, the ladwp brought in $331 million selling power to the state between jan. 18 and may 31 this year. the ladwp, which didn't take part in the state's deregulation debacle and which isn't under the jurisdiction of federal energy regulators, also cashed in throughout 2000. the utility has 7,000 megawatts of generation capacity but only needs about 5,500 mw to serve its retail customers, freeing it to sell as much as 1,000 megawatts to the iso at prices comparable to what the generators were charging. the ladwp did so well that it was able to pay down $200 million in debt and will reduce its customers' rates in 2002. ""it just shows you that enterprise is where you find it,"" freeman said in an interview last year. last july, ratings agency fitch concluded that california's electricity shortage provided ladwp ""an opportunity for the sale of surplus power at favorable prices which added to the municipal system's coffers."" according to a report by the iso, manager of the state's electricity grid, the ladwp overcharged california for power from may 2000 through february 2001 by as much as $20 million. maviglio said the state will pursue refunds from the utility. on tuesday, an ladwp spokesman defended the utility's power prices, saying the costs of producing electricity were extremely high. the iso has estimated that the state was overcharged nearly $9 billion for electricity sales in the 12 months ended may 2001. on monday, settlement talks between state officials and generators over the refunds broke down. other municipal utilities, including the sacramento municipal utility district and private companies like bc hydro in canada, have also racked up enormous sums selling surplus power to california at the last minute. -by jason leopold, dow jones newswires; ; (end) dow jones newswires 07-10-01 1557edt (ap-dj)--07-10-01 1557edt :ticker: eix pcg sre : copyright (c) 2001 dow jones and company, inc. received by newsedge/lan: 7/10/01 12:57 pm"

has added siemens solar industries, l.p., to its growing portfolio of suppliers for distributed generation products. through its new agreement with siemens solar industries, allegheny energy solutions will provide its customers with a comprehensive offering of solar electric solutions called earthsafe =01v. the systems are suited for industrial, commercial an= d residential applications. the new partnership further advances allegheny's strategy of becoming a national energy supplier. analysis: this partnership comes on the heels of allegheny's recently=20 announced agreement to purchase three gas-fired merchant plants from enron north america. both deals reaffirm allegheny's intent to expand its geographic footprint and strengthen the scope of its unregulated generation capability= . in my opinion, allegheny is one of a handful of companies that have further= ed very aggressive generation expansion plans this year, announcing one=20 acquisition or development after another. the company has added seven new offices in the northeastern united states over the last year, and has disclosed that it will open new offices in the southeast in 2001 to begin preparing for the albeit slow move to competition in that region. the partnership with siemens is particularly interesting as it indicates that allegheny believes solar power will become a significant part of its service offerings. siemens solar is one competitive business in siemens' portfolio of companies, specializing in high and medium voltage, protection and substation control systems, power and distribution transformers, system planning, and decentralized energy supply systems. siemens solar claims to be the number one provider of solar-power solutions in the world, having shipped solar cells and modules with a cumulative peak power of 200 mw. the company has been in business for about 20 years, and reached a mileston= e of 100 mw in 1996. thus, the company has doubled its production output in just four years. siemens solar offers an array of solar-related products. as noted, alleghen= y energy solutions will be adopting siemen's earthsafe platform which, accord= ing to information on siemen's website, is offered in four models ranging in dc power from 300 watts to 1,200 watts. the earthsafe system consists of solar modules, universal roof mounting kits, dc/ac inverters, and interconn= ect hardware. the intent is that businesses and residences would install the earthsafe system to supply a portion of their energy needs (the remainder supplied by more traditional means) and contribute to the efforts of reduci= ng emissions from fossil fuel plants. allegheny energy solutions claims that the addition of the siemens' product to its service offerings positions it as one of the only suppliers of distributed generation products to offer a complete on-site power solution. i think that this is a smart move for allegheny to take as it certainly diversifies the company's service offerings. although the jury is still out regarding the profitability of solar power, along with other forms of distributed and renewable energy sources, for allegheny the move makes sense as it attempts to offer on a national scale a full package of energy solutions. allegheny energy supply, where most of the generation expansion efforts of its parent are focused, develops competitive generation solution= s (e.g., cogeneration, green power, etc.) for a variety of end users. within the last year, allegheny energy solutions has made great strides in moving from a regional player into a national energy supplier, resulting primarily from its success in the strong northeast market. this venture into solar continues a decided focus on distributed generation on the part of the unregulated company. earlier this year, allegheny energy solutions formed a partnership with capstone turbine corporation under which the capstone microturbine was installed at allegheny energy's mitchel= l power station in new eagle, pa. allegheny energy solutions is providing technical and economic analysis of the unit for the customers of its parent company. this was a very strategic partnership for allegheny as it makes the company one of the few system integrators of the capstone microturbine in the northeast. the diversification of allegheny's generation arsenal is also important because it gives the company a possible edge over direct competitors.=20 allegheny must surely know that companies like dominion, reliant and aes=01*just to name a few=01*are also aggressively stacking up generation assets in key ar= eas across the country. thus, by adding diverse power options to its service offerings, allegheny conceivably will have more to offer customers in its energy supply packages. i observed several months ago that allegheny was probably in search of a unique niche to set itself apart from other compani= es that are strong in generation. this partnership with siemens seems to indic= ate that distributed generation, including solar power, could become that niche= . as a sidenote, allegheny energy was just added to standard & poor's 500 index earlier this week. so, the announcement that the company is diversify= ing into solar power comes at a time when, as ceo alan noia puts it, ""our stron= g growth strategy and resulting solid financial performance"" have received recognition. the s&p 500 index is widely regarded as the standard for=20 measuring large-capitalization u.s. stock market performance. as of yesterday (dec. 7), allegheny energy's stock (nyse: aye) was priced at $42 5/16. the only red flag that i can determine for this deal relates to siemens, not allegheny energy solutions. competition among companies that develop products related to solar power has become pretty fierce as of late, and there is still a great deal of uncertainty surrounding the profitability of this market. one direct competitor to siemens that i've tracked recently is evergreen solar, a company whose string ribbon technology reportedly cuts in half the required use of silicon, which is needed for most solar-po= wer technologies. evergreen solar, which recently became a publicly traded company, has acknowledged that its own market prospects are uncertain and that it may never become a profitable company. the same market conditions apply to siemens solar industries, so the compan= y may have a difficult time in finding wide application for its solar power units. this is, of course, an issue for siemens, and not allegheny, to address. under its partnership with siemens, allegheny attains all the value of solar power technologies and little of the risks. thus, this appea= rs to be a smart venture for allegheny and one that should strongly benefit its power supply opportunities. =3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=3d=

"cc: bcc: john, lou, cutty, bill, i want to bring this issue back up for your attention, as i know that everyone is very busy. during the epa title v inspection at the laguna c/s this past week, barbara bernacek, the laguna environmental person was present. she had been asked to be there by the epa. during our tour of the facility, she casually asked if any progress or decision had been made by enron management towards remediation assistance in the groundwater issue at the laguna c/s. i had informed her that we were still actively discussing this issue and would contact her in the near future concerning management's decision. i would appreciate it very much if each of you would revisit my memo below and then lets discuss what should be done and the approach we should take in addressing the laguna's concern about a proactive approach to reaching cleanup and closure. ---------------------- forwarded by larry campbell/et&s/enron on 02/16/2001 08:43 am --------------------------- larry campbell 01/24/2001 10:07 am william cc: rich rick butch george team ted i wanted to present this summary of the meeting transwestern had with representatives of the laguna pueblo concerning the status of the pcb remediation activities by tw. on the laguna side were members of the laguna pueblo, the peop a technical oversight group that provides expertise and assistance on technical issues for all of the 19 pueblos in new mexico (ranging from ust to superfund), and members of ets ( 5 members of the laguna team, butch russell, rick smith (advisor for the laguna team), myself) and george robinson. this is the third meeting we had in the last year and a half with this group since the lagunas have started showing renewed interest in environmental activities on their pueblo. the meeting centered around two issues at the site: the closure of the ust and the pcb remediation activity. with respect to the first, concensus was reached that we would continue monitoring and collecting groundwater samples at the two downstream well locations from the ust site on a quarterly basis, and send the results to poep for review. with repsect to the pcb remediation issue, things were a little different. the poep representatives expressed concern on behalf of the laguna tribal coucil that the progress of the remediation activities transwestern is presently using to bring closure to the site is not showing positive goals toward achieving cleanup at the site and that the data submittals to the lagunas have verified this. they indicated that that have been patient with transwstern's attempts to allow natural attenuation to reduce the pcb contamination, but based upon the historic sampling results, that this technology is not proving to be very successful, in fact the results have shown stagnant results (im using their words). they would like to see transwestern implement other more proactive technologies to arrive at cleanup and closure of this site. members of the laguna pueblo, who work for the poep, expressed concern that the pcb contamination could negatively impact future generations of lagunas members and that it was the responsibility of transwestern to clean up the contamination which they brought onto their lands. one member of the laguna pueblo called the contamination a ""cancer"" with potential to spread. a comment was made by the poep that there was a major potential of increasing the magnitude and spread of the contamination if we continue to just maintain our present approach of just monitoring the site and installing additional wells.. a member of the poep has been in contact with a consortum of individuals from north dakota state university, (energy and environmental research center) who claim to be experts in reclamation of contaminated sites which are considered difficult to remediate (this site would certainly fall into this category due to the presence of the sandstone bedrock which has numerous cracks and channels present which direct the pcb containing liquids present at the site). although the poep was not recommending transwestern utilize their service, they did strongly suggest that we should at least discuss this site with them. it shold also be mentioned that syed risvi, the poep superfund representative was at this meeting. he had mentioned that the poep has been in discussions with epa region vi concerning potential classification of the site on the cerclis list of sites for inclusion on the npl.. he had indicated that he did not want to see this site included on the list, but stated that transwetern needed to update and show postive results in our remediation efforts and that it was the tribal councils opinion that this was not being done. at the conclusion of the meeting, i informed the poep that transwestern's internal remediation group would contact the ndsu group and discuss the site characteristics with them and we would reprot back to them the results of our discussions. this seemed to satisify the poep and they were content with this. john, i would like to schedule a conference call with the above list of people and discuss this issue. a couple of things i want to bring out. first, we will be undergoing row and compressor station renewals with the lagunas in the near future. second, on the laguna tribal lands, they have experienced other releases of contimation and are currently very sensitive to this whole contamination problem. although we are considered by the poep as proactive up to this point and very easy to work with (direct quote from the poep) they are wanting a more proactive and measurable effort from transwestern to clean up the pcbs. please get back with me on this."

"cc: bcc: i still think it is imperative that we use our book position, by rate schedule and time period (on-peak, off-peak) , to quantify the sensitivity to different types of rate designs. for instance, if there is a large increase in summer on-peak, how much of the increase can we avoid with aggressive dsm, etc. can we look at this quantification today? scott 04/02/2001 09:34 pm cc: don black, tamara harry kingerski harry and i are meeting tomorrow. i would like any feedback you have related to the following: based on our position we would prefer: later surcharges lower surcharges surcharges that are lower in the summer (flatter is better because it is closer, the npv effects and our rapidly diminishing position) the proposal below could either result in: delay of a month while they consider this complicated affair (low likelihood) lower surcharge if we can convince people that market rates are $300/mwh for a year when they are actually $200. we would only get a $20/mwh increase, as compared to a $30/mwh increase. ie (1-90%) times $300/mwh yields $30/mwh is our story when the actural is (1-90%)times $200/mwh yields $20/mwh. the enron rates below are effectively much flatter than the cpuc proposal. thus we would be better off if accepted. additionally if our noise causes a flat $30/mwh increase to replace the cpuc proposal, we are better off. additionally, we could sell hedging on the 10% exposed to markets. dsm related to capital investments should be less risky. the risks to enron are: proposal makes it easy to hit the large customers with a lower baseline (ie 75% instead of 90%) would make dsm more risky. dsm providers would have to buy hedges to proceed. the questions to answer are: could enron provide witnesses without drawing more negatives would a partner tow the enron line ---------------------- forwarded by scott stoness/hou/ees on 04/02/2001 09:22 pm --------------------------- scott stoness 04/02/2001 09:21 pm cc: harry kingerski summary: the cpuc should implement two part rtp/tou rates for pge/sce. a two part rate is a rate where customers pay their historical rate for consumption of normal load and pay market value for consumption incremental (or decremental) to normal load. the cpuc should define normal consumption as consumption over and above 90% of historical 2000 consumption. the cpuc should define the hourly rate as the highest hourly price paid by dwr for spot purchases in that hour. in the event that implementation of two part rtp/tou rates is complicated to design, the $30/mwh surcharge should be applied to all customers until the implementation of two part rtp/tou rates is possible. the current draft design, of the cpuc, is discriminatory to large customers. the current draft design, of the cpuc, does not provide appropriate price signals. the current draft design, of the cpuc, results in rate increases to large customers that are unneccessarly high. the current draft design, of the cpuc, results in rate increases to large customers, that are far in excess of those which the cpuc intended. the current draft design, of the cpuc, results is static and does not respond to changing market conditions. design goals: the cpuc should design rates that: give appropriate price signals to customers to consume / conserve energy as as close to marginal price as possible in as many hours as possible. treat all rate classes in a fair and consistent manner. achieve targeted revenue requirements. are easy to administer and understand. summary of cpuc illustrative design: the cpuc has proposed rates that move on peak pricing in the summer close to marginal rates: draft proposal provides marginal price signal of about $370/mwh for e19 secondary from in summer weekdays from noon to 6pm draft proposal provides marginal price signal of about $75/mwh for e19 secondary from in all other hours. critique based on design goals: draft proposals move toward marginal rates but fall short. the rates for power, mar 30 2001, based on dj-np15, on peak is $181.94/mwh. the rates for power, mar 30 2001, based on dj-np15, off peak is $93.46/mwh. the proposed marginal rates for e19 secondary, is $75/mwh for on peak and off peak. this rate design will not encourage investments in assets that result in lower consumption in the winter or in off peak periods. draft proposal falls short on treating customers on a consistent basis: e20 transmission voltage customers will experience a 87% rate increase. e19 secondary voltage customers will experience a 41% rate increase. a10 medium general service customers will experience a 20% rate increase. a1 small l&p customers will experience a 16% rate increase. the marginal price signal for a10 will be $121/mwh vs $370/mwh for e-20 transmission in the on peak summer. the marginal price signal for e10 wills be 107/mwh vs $55/mwh for e-20 transmission in the off peak periods. pge has a longer summer period than sce. this results in a 69% increase for sce tou-8-sub as compared to 87% increases for pge e20 transmission rate. the proposal also results in far different marginal price signals for sce customers than pge customers. for example the on peak rate for sce tou-8-sub is $128/mwh as compared to pge e20 transmission rate of $374/mwh. draft proposal does do a good job of recovering $2.2b of revenue. draft proposal require some implementation but given that the surcharge increase does not ocur until may for pge and june for sce, it should be possible to implement. enron proposed rates: enron proposes: two part real time pricing time of use rate, usage up to 90% of historical use would be billed at historical rates. usage incremental or decremental to 90% of historical use, would be billed at dj-np15 on peak and dj-np15 off peak, where customers has real time metering. usage incremental or decremental to 90% of historical use, would be billed at dj-np15 on peak and dj-np15 off peak averaged over the month, where customers has time of use metering. usage incremental or decremental to 90% of historical use, would be billed at 45% of dj-np15 on peak and 55% of dj-np15 off peak averaged over the month, where customers has just energy metering. critique based on design goals: enron proposals charge all customer at very close to marginal rates. thus, within the constraints of using dow jones, the rates should be very close to the actual marginal rates. the rates will not be exact because they are: determined on the previous day ony differentiate between on and off peak, as compared to hour by hour. to the extent that the customer does not have real time metering capability, the rates will be determined on a class average basis. however, the rates be far superior to the cpuc draft design because: they give better price signals to night consumption they give better signals to weekend consumption they give better signals to winter consumption they are self correcting in that they do not require predetermination of marginal costs. for example, if summer costs are lower, the rate will be lower. the enron proposal will motivate dsm activities in winter, summer and off peak. enron proposal results in similar rate structure and impact regardless of utility and rate class. the enron proposal results in a similar concept for commerical and industrial as with residential. ab1x provides that residential customers that consume energy below normal rates will not have increased rates. this design also achieves the same effect for commercial and industrial customers. draft proposal does do a good job of recovering $2.2b of revenue but even more importantly it ensures tracking of costs. setting the normal load at 90% of historical load results in a $30/mwh increase if the market value for the entire year is $300/mwh. in the event that the market value for the entire year is less than $300/mwh, the resulting cost decreases will offset the lost revenue. the enron proposed rate design structure is flexi ble enough that it can easily be changed to achieve greater or lessor revenue to achieve price signals and revenue targets. the revenue outcome is less certain than the cpuc draft design however the impact should be more certain because the revenue will automatically go up when the costs go up. draft proposal require greater implementation details than the cpuc design but such extra costs are worthwhile. the enron proposal requires: determination of historical loads for large customers determination of class consumption profiles for demand metered customers determination of class consumption profiles for energy metered customers determination of customer profiles in the event that the customers is a new customer then enron proposal has the following negatives: some customers who have reduced load from historical levels will be better off even though they have not changed their behaviour in response to the new price signals the rates will require greater administrative costs since they are different for each customer. the rates may take more work to put in place for the utility the rates will result in similar customers paying dissimilar rates, depending upon the historical consumption of the customers q. in the event that it is not possible to implement the enron rates by june 1, 2001, what would you propose a an interim solution: a. the cpuc draft rates are so flawed, that it would be superior to just implement a flat $30/mwh surcharge to all customers. this approach would be fairer and simpler. q. who would pay for the decremental consumption of customers? a. the dwr will incur a decline in their costs equal to the decrease in rates of the utilities. the are indifferent to buy more generation or selling less energy to customers. thus the dwr should be willing to pay for decremental consumption. in the event that the dwr is not agreeable to paying for decremental consumption, the utility should be allowed to borrow such funds and have the costs amortized for the next 10 years. in the event that the utility is unable to fund decremental consumption, the normal load could be defined 85% of historical and the cpuc could eliminate credits resulting from decremental consumption. such solution would discourage conservation below 15% but would not be expected to diminish the effectiveness of the enron proposed rates. q. why is dj-np15 the right index to choose? a. dj-np15 and dj-sp15 are availble for each weekday for on and off peak pricing. the index is a mathematical average of trades in the previous day for today. the dj index is compiled based on the information provided by many of the large trading companies including enron. the numbers provided by the participants are subject to audit. thus dj is the best avaible information available for energy pricing. q. what index is suitable for weekends? a. enron proposes that the average dj-np15 off peak energy charges for friday and monday be used to determine the weekend rates for the purpose of rate setting."

"vince, you may have already thought about this, but i thought it was an interesting way to look at the problem. jan june 4, 2001 the mirage of a growing fuel supply by evar d. nering cottsdale, ariz. - when i discussed the exponential function in the first-semester calculus classes that i taught, i invariably used consumption of a nonrenewable natural resource as an example. since we are now engaged in a national debate about energy policy, it may be useful to talk about the mathematics involved in making a rational decision about resource use. in my classes, i described the following hypothetical situation. we have a 100-year supply of a resource, say oil - that is, the oil would last 100 years if it were consumed at its current rate. but the oil is consumed at a rate that grows by 5 percent each year. how long would it last under these circumstances? this is an easy calculation; the answer is about 36 years. oh, but let's say we underestimated the supply, and we actually have a 1,000-year supply. at the same annual 5 percent growth rate in use, how long will this last? the answer is about 79 years. then let us say we make a striking discovery of more oil yet - a bonanza - and we now have a 10,000-year supply. at our same rate of growing use, how long would it last? answer: 125 years. estimates vary for how long currently known oil reserves will last, though they are usually considerably less than 100 years. but the point of this analysis is that it really doesn't matter what the estimates are. there is no way that a supply-side attack on america's energy problem can work. the exponential function describes the behavior of any quantity whose rate of change is proportional to its size. compound interest is the most commonly encountered example - it would produce exponential growth if the interest were calculated at a continuing rate. i have heard public statements that use ""exponential"" as though it describes a large or sudden increase. but exponential growth does not have to be large, and it is never sudden. rather, it is inexorable. calculations also show that if consumption of an energy resource is allowed to grow at a steady 5 percent annual rate, a full doubling of the available supply will not be as effective as reducing that growth rate by half - to 2.5 percent. doubling the size of the oil reserve will add at most 14 years to the life expectancy of the resource if we continue to use it at the currently increasing rate, no matter how large it is currently. on the other hand, halving the growth of consumption will almost double the life expectancy of the supply, no matter what it is. this mathematical reality seems to have escaped the politicians pushing to solve our energy problem by simply increasing supply. building more power plants and drilling for more oil is exactly the wrong thing to do, because it will encourage more use. if we want to avoid dire consequences, we need to find the political will to reduce the growth in energy consumption to zero - or even begin to consume less. i must emphasize that reducing the growth rate is not what most people are talking about now when they advocate conservation; the steps they recommend are just band-aids. if we increase the gas mileage of our automobiles and then drive more miles, for example, that will not reduce the growth rate. reducing the growth of consumption means living closer to where we work or play. it means telecommuting. it means controlling population growth. it means shifting to renewable energy sources. it is not, perhaps, necessary to cut our use of oil, but it is essential that we cut the rate of increase at which we consume it. to do otherwise is to leave our descendants in an impoverished world. evar d. nering is professor emeritus of mathematics at arizona state university. copyright 2001 the new york times company | privacy information get your free download of msn explorer at"

"louise - while we were looking at opportunities for offline and the value proposition a potential software vendor might make to banks, we stumbled across ""asset backed securities"" and its complete lack of market making. it appears to be a very large market, controlled by ""dealers"" who control issuance of abs commercial paper, and among themselves control an informal secondary market. given the size of the market, and the players who seek to issue the paper (ge, siemen, ford, credit card companies, etc.), i was curious as to how enron would view the opportunity. my original intention for this piece was to talk to a bank or two about how they might use our system to do this themselves and outmanuever the ""controlling dealers"". also a firm has opened for business that purports to bypass the ""issuance process"" at a much lower cost, but has no way to help a secondary market along. if we could work with them on a ""secondary market"", perhaps this could evolve. we have had some positive feedback from rahil, brandon, and tom gros but i thought you might provide an overall corporate view! thanks - david -----original message----- sent: friday, april 06, 2001 9:27 am david, per our discussion, attached is the latest presentation. regards, kara"

"--------- inline attachment follows --------- bear destroyed after fatal attack in canada compiled by outside online june 6, 2001 a black bear that attacked and killed a camper in canada's northwest territories was shot yesterday by wildlife officials, according to press reports. coroners determined that the bear shot yesterday was the same animal that mauled 18-year-old kyle harry on saturday while he was camping with friends near yellowknife. the bear had been shot by a rcmp officer at the scene of the attack on saturday and a necropsy uncovered bullet fragments in the bear's chest that matched the type of bullet used by the officer, a wildlife official told the london free press. harry and five other teens had camped overnight on friday before four members of the group left early on saturday morning, the london free press reports. harry and a 14-year-old girl stayed behind and saw the bear come into their campground around noon. they pulled their food inside of their tent then later made a break for a ridge after the bear approached the tent. the girl was able to escape and get to the road where she was taken to the hospital by a passing car. harry, caught by the bear as he ascended the ridge, was found dead by officials. a report yesterday by the outdoor network says the bear was feeding on harry when officials arrived. on sunday police and wildlife officials launched an intensive search for the animal, employing a helicopter and infrared scanner. another bear shot on monday was determined not be the one responsible for the attack. on july 2 of last year, 24-year-old canadian biathlete mary-beth miller was killed by a black bear while on a training run at the myriam bedard biathlon centre near quebec city."

"louise, this is the email written by paul bienawski regarding a potential aquisition of bistineau. you had mentioned an interest in seeing this email last week. mrha -----original message----- sent: thursday, august 23, 2001 9:54 pm cc: mrha, jean; gregory, paul importance: high don, this is a long e-mail and i apologize for that but since we have not had a chance to talk, i wanted to send you some information on bistineau as well as the latest output from the storage group's m & a analysis. the m&a analysis was just updated as they have been several reservoir transactions in the past few months (aec @ manchester, atmos @ east diamond, and aquila @ lodi). prior to these transactions we did not have enough data points to draw meaningful conclusions about the trends in reservoir acquisition. i have attached the output for your review but i think a couple of points are key. the reservoir curve is ""hockey-sticking"" just as the salt curve did previously. while not as dramatic as salt, the premiums are increasing dramatically. the market is not placing a premium on optionality. salt is inherently more flexible than a reservoir, yet on a deliverability basis, there does not appear to be a significant difference. that may explain why we see players who do value optionality in the marketplace (aquila, aec, duke, etc). these companies have long established asset based storage groups and actively trade around these assets. as far as bistineau is concerned, there are several points worth highlighting. i have attached output from the database maintained by the storage group for your reference. i have not included caverns but we do have that data. reliant energy is part owner of the facility. reliant is aggressively trying to build a merchant storage business. my group has bumped into them several times in the marketplace. since the facility is federally regulated, reliant and koch would be required to make a nga 7(b) filing to abandon the services they provide their customers before anyone could purchase the reservoir. the length of this process would be a function of the number of intervenors. bistineau is a very large reservoir with a large amount of native base gas. how much of this volume is recoverable (and therefore monetizable) is a large question mark. relative to its peers, bistineau is a poor performer in terms of flexibility (low injection capabilities) koch has, in the past, written off losses at bistineau. the low injection rate may be as a result of this. i have not researched the exact amount of the losses but a seach of ferc filings would reveal the nature and extent of the losses. epps likewise has had some loss problems. if enron's intent is to establish a storage asset position in louisiana, south downsville would probably be the best candidate. the field is privately held, under development, has many interconnects, and acquisition would probably meet little resistance given the lack of customers. while i have not communicated with matrix in some time, i do know the principals and could easily get an update on their status and plans. i will not be in tomorrow morning, but should you wish to discuss this e-mail, feel free to call me on my cell phone @ ."

""in a more sinister form of cogeneration, corporations are converting economic into political power,"" he says. ""a bush election fueled by enron dollars could ignite in the public policy arena, and consumers would get burned."" and so may people in the third world. amnesty international and human rights watch have both criticized enron for colluding with police who brutally suppressed protests at the company's giant power plant in western india. the plant's operating firm is called the dabhol power company. from 1992 to 1998, enron owned 80 percent of it, with general electric and bechtel each holding a 10 percent share. (in 1998, the indian state electricity board bought a 30 percent share of the company, which reduced enron's stake to 50 percent.) for years, the plant has been the site of many nonviolent protests. ""the project has met with opposition from local people and activists from elsewhere in india on the grounds of its social, economic, and environmental impact,"" amnesty wrote in a july 1997 report. ""protesters and activists have been subjected to harassment, arbitrary arrest, preventive detention under the ordinary criminal law, and ill treatment. amnesty international considers those who have been subjected to arrest and temporary periods of imprisonment as a result of undertaking peaceful protest to be prisoners of conscience, imprisoned solely for exercising their right to freedom of expression."" amnesty's report found that ""women, who have been at the forefront of local agitation, appear to have been a particular target."" just before dawn on june 3, 1997, police stormed the homes of several women. ""the policemen forcibly opened the door and dragged me out of the house into the police van parked on the road. (while dragging me) the police kept beating me on my back with batons. the humiliation meted out to the other members of my family was similar to the way i was humiliated. . . . my one-and-a-half year-old daughter held on to me but the police kicked her away,"" says sugandha vasudev bhalekar-a twenty-four-year-old housewife who was three months pregnant at the time of her arrest, according to amnesty's report. amnesty found that another pregnant woman was beaten and several other women sustained injuries, including bruising, abrasions, and lacerations on arms and legs. amnesty said the police involved in suppressing protests included ""the special reserve police [srp] on the site of the company."" it added: ""the involvement of the srp in the harassment of protesters indicates the need for the three u.s. multinationals participating in the joint venture to take steps to ensure that all the management and staff of the dpc [dabhol power company)-in particular, any security staff subcontracted to, seconded to, or employed by the company-are trained in human rights and are fully accountable for their actions. a january 1999 investigation by human rights watch came to a stronger conclusion. ""human rights watch believes that the dabhol power corporation and its parent company enron are complicit in these human rights violations,"" it said. ""the company, under provisions of law, paid the abusive state forces for the security they provided to the company. these forces, located adjacent to the project site, were only stationed there to deal with protests. in addition, contractors (for dpc) engaged in a pattern of harassment, intimidation, and attacks on individuals opposed to the dabhol power project. . . . the dabhol power corporation refused to acknowledge that its contractors were responsible for criminal acts and did not adequately investigate, condemn, or cease relationships with these individuals."" enron denies any wrongdoing. ""while we respect the mission of human rights watch, we do not feel that its report on the dabhol power project is accurate,"" says an enron spokesperson. ""the report refers to peaceful protests, when, in fact, the reason the police were positioned near our site is that there have been many acts of violence against our employees and contractors. dabhol power company has worked hard to promote positive relations with the community. unfortunately, the good relationship we have built with a large percentage of the community was not reflected in the report. enron is committed to providing energy and communications services while preserving the human rights of citizens and our workers."" enron has also raised a stink in bolivia with its involvement in the cuiaba integrated energy project. the project is run by transredes, bolivia's hydrocarbon transport company, which came into being in 1997 after bolivia privatized its oil sector under the influence of the world bank. a joint venture of enron and shell owns 50 percent of transredes. on january 31, 2000, a transredes oil pipeline erupted and dumped an estimated 10,000 barrels of refined crude oil and gasoline into the desaguadero river, which supports indigenous communities such as the uru muratos. ""this problem is transredes's number one priority, and we are committed to continue to work hard to mitigate the short- and long-term social and environmental impact,"" wrote steve hopper, president of transredes, in a letter addressed ""to the people of bolivia"" on february 7. facing starvation from the loss of their life-sustaining waterfowl and fish, the uru muratos left their ancestral lands at the southern shores of lake poopo in april and marched eighty-five miles to the city of oruro to ask for government help. ""we subsequently reached an agreement with them to provide certain levels of relief and assistance,"" says keith miceli, general manager for public relations for enron, south america. in its actions overseas, enron has made a practice of taking advantage of corporate welfare. and it has enlisted george w bush in this effort. for example, in march 1997, lay wrote a letter to bush that was subsequently released to the press under texas open records laws, asking him to contact every member of the texas delegation in congress to explain how ""export credit agencies of the united states are critical to u.s. developers like enron, who are pursuing international projects in developing countries."" these agencies include the overseas private investment corporation (opic), which provides political risk coverage and financial support to u.s. companies investing abroad. ""opic provided financing or insurance coverage worth almost $300 million for enron's foreign projects just last year, according to government records,"" the new york times reported. ""enron officials have in the past asked mr. bush to help lobby lawmakers to appropriate funds of opic, as well as for the export-import bank, another federal agency that aids american companies abroad."" enron received $200 million in political risk insurance for the dabhol project in 1996. and it received $200 million in insurance from opic in 1999 for its bolivian project. the enron methanol plant in pasadena, texas, lies in the houston ship channel area, the nation's largest concentration of petrochemical plants just east of the city. the plant has won special concessions from governor bush, allowing the company to pollute without a permit, as well as giving it immunity from prosecution for violating some environmental standards. plants like this in texas cumulatively emit twice as much nitrogen oxide, a key ingredient of smog, as do all the nine million cars in texas put together. only 7 percent of the more than 3,500 tons of nitrogen oxide emitted by the enron methanol plant in 1997 would have been permitted had enron not gotten away with this under the ""grandfather clause"" of the 1971 texas clean air act, which allows plants built before 1971 to continue their polluting practices. bush extended this clause under the 1999 clean air responsibility enterprise (care) program that his office drew up in a series of secret meetings with representatives of the top polluters in the state, as molly ivins reported. care waives permit requirements for plants that volunteer to cut emissions. the care program is backed up by an act that bush signed in may 1995 giving sweeping protections to polluters that perform internal environmental or safety audits. the law makes these audit documents confidential and allows polluters to escape responsibility for environmental violations. to date, enron has conducted five such audits and filed for immunity from prosecution for violations of the law, according to the texas natural resources conservation commission (tnrcc), the state equivalent of the environmental protection agency. tamara maschini, who lives about five miles from the enron plant, is one of the founders of a local environmental group called clean air clear lake. ""whole families in this neighborhood have asthma because of the pollution from plants like enron,"" she says. mark palmer, head of public relations for enron, says that the company's contribution to local pollution is minimal. ""if the grandfather clause was canceled right now, we would benefit the most of any of the companies in texas because our nitrogen oxide emissions add up to less than half a percent of the total,"" he says. last year, the bush campaign borrowed enron's corporate jets eight times to fly aides around the country, more times than any of the thirty-four other companies that made their company aircraft available to the presidential hopeful. and lay often acts as george w. bush's chaperone. on april 7, 2000, he played host to bush and his father, the former president, at the houston astros' first home game of the season. the game was held in the baseball team's brand new stadium-enron field-which was built with the help of a $100 million donation from enron. (the company got free advertising, a tax break, and a $200 million contract to supply power to the stadium in return.) less than three weeks later, lay joined candidate bush in washington, d.c., for a republican fundraiser that topped all previous records by bringing in a staggering $21.3 million, easily the biggest one-night haul for any political party in history. ""ken lay is a noted business leader in texas who has long been active in republican politics,"" says ray sullivan, a spokesman for the bush campaign. ""he is chair of the governor's business council. but the governor has his own agenda based on what he believes is best for texas and for the country."" for his part, lay tries to put his contributions in a favorable light.

"hi nellie, what's happening? i sent you and momma some new pictures of the boys, if you have not received yet, you should receive either today or tuesday. i made the hotel reservations for phoenix at the embassey suites, the rate is $159.00 per night, pretty expensive, but the nascar is in town, and we can split it three ways. hopefully, there is a sofa sleeper in the room, although i did not ask, i asked for two queen beds, in case there is not. now i just need to get the car reserved and we're all set. i spoke with shawna on friday and asked her to check with her wedding coordinator to see if she could improve that rate, so far i have not heard anything back from her yet, nor am i holding my breath. she said her colors are burgundy and gold, if i remember correctly. jordan is still taking gymnastics and his coach came over and told me that jordan was so good, that he would like jordan to be in an accelerated class for his age group. this class is called the ""hope team"" and it gets the kids ready for competition. i did not realize he was that good, although i could clearly see that he was the best in his class (proud mom). i called to inquire about the cost, and the receptionist quickly told me"" ma'm you have to be invited to be in that class, you just can't enroll, and i said, yes, ma'm we have been invited to enroll, thank you very much!"" well, anyway, we'll see b/c the class is from 3:30 to 4:30 p.m. each day. we'll see, i know he would really enjoy it. kendall is enrolled for his first gynmastics class beginning october 23rd. i was thinking he would really enjoy it, but the more i think about it, he'll probably want to be in jordan's class (oh boy!!). i spoke with daddy last week, and he's supposed to be checking into possibly getting tickets to come down for thanksgiving. let me know what you're hearing? talk to you later."

2001, the washington post co. all rights reserved in football, ""piling on"" a player who's already been tackled means a major penalty that can set your team back a long way. but when it comes to markets, piling on by taking advantage of the weak is called ""opportunism,"" and it can get you a big bonus. which brings us to california, where piling on enfeebled utilities and customers by power generators and power traders has become a way of life. thanks to the idiotic way that california deregulated its electricity markets, the generators and traders of power in the state have been making a fortune because electricity costs have gone through the roof. meanwhile, consumers are getting pounded rather than protected, economic instability is spreading throughout the western united states and some of the utilities that distribute power are getting clobbered. one big utility, pacific gas & electric, has already gone broke, and others may soon follow. but while the market has produced a horde of losers -- california's wholesale power bill is running at 10 times the level of two years ago -- there are some big winners: companies that generate or trade power in the california market. among the winners: calpine, whose first-quarter profit quintupled compared with last year's; reliant energy and williams cos., whose profits more than doubled; mirant, up 84 percent; and dynegy and duke energy, whose wholesale power profits doubled and quadrupled, respectively. enron, the nation's biggest energy trader, had a 75 percent increase in wholesale-services profits, but it says little of that was from california. some of these companies' profits would have risen far more -- mirant's would have quadrupled -- had they not taken big earnings hits to cover the risk of not being paid for some of their california sales. if they finally get paid, their profits will be outta sight. you can see why some of these companies' stocks have heated up as california melted down. to be fair, you can't attribute the entire increases to california -- but you can be sure california accounts for a good portion of them. there are other, less obvious winners, too. among them: the unregulated subsidiaries of some companies that own california utilities; aluminum producers that are making more money by closing their plants and selling their power allotments than they would have made by producing aluminum; farms that find it more profitable to resell electricity than to grow crops; and, in general, anyone in the western united states or canada with an electron to spare and some way of getting it into california. i'm not saying that these companies are immoral for making a fortune by taking advantage of california's problems. breaking the law by creating an artificial shortage -- which has been alleged, but not remotely proven -- would be immoral. taking advantage of a situation? that's what's known as amoral -- having no moral values, either good or bad. it's not nice, but it's perfectly legal, and it's the way market players are expected to act. so when california gov. gray davis said last week that he was planning to have a ""heart-to-heart"" talk with california power generators, you just had to laugh. because when it comes to business, those people have no hearts. they're not supposed to. what created the problem in california is not only deregulation, but a stupid deregulation plan carried out ineptly: the kilowatt keystone cops, as it were. california put a cap on the rates that utilities could charge customers, but until recently it forced utilities to buy all of their power in the short-term market. the utilities foolishly agreed to this deal. the problem: short-term markets are notoriously volatile. and notoriously ruthless. if there's a small surplus of power, you have desperate sellers trying to sell electricity, which can't be stored. but if there's a shortage, everyone piles on. had california utilities been allowed to do the rational thing and buy most of their power in long-term markets, they would have paid more initially, but they and their customers would be in far better shape now. compounding the problem is that while the state deregulated the wholesale rates the utilities paid for power, they capped the retail rates utilities could charge. combine that with total reliance on the short-term market and -- voila! -- you're totally at the market's mercy. and markets have no mercy. in the old days, when utilities were regulated, there was often waste and inefficiency, but power was reliable and utilities cared desperately about keeping the lights on. now, we have markets that don't care about anything. someday, markets may give us total reliability at a cheaper price than regulation would. but in the meantime, get used to the piling-on concept. just hope you end up on top of the pile. kevin peraino contributed to this column. sloan is newsweek's wall street editor. his e-mail address is copyright

(update1) (adds background on trading system in fifth paragraph.) london, may 8 (bloomberg) -- enron corp., the world's biggest energy trader, may consider bidding for u.k. power stations to reduce its risk in trading and make more money from swings in electricity prices, an executive said. enron is vying with european and u.s. rivals for dominance in u.k. electricity trading, a market worth about 7.5 billion pounds ($11 billion) a year. edison mission energy and txu corp. have both said they may sell power stations in the u.k. under a new system of electricity trading introduced in england in march, a company unable to deliver power to a customer as agreed must buy it on the market. the fluctuation in prices offers companies such as enron and u.k. rivals powergen plc and innogy holdings plc gains or losses of as much as 1,000 percent. ``a physical power station can put bids and offers into the balancing mechanism,'' said richard lewis, managing director of enron's u.k. power and gas, in an interview. ``there is high volatility to extract there and that is valuable. we look at all opportunities.'' the regulator, ofgem, hopes the new trading system will increase competition in the electricity market. under previous rules, companies weren't penalized if they didn't deliver. prices for electricity in the spot market, or the so-called balancing mechanism, have varied from 1,036 pounds a megawatt hour to a negative 434 pounds a megawatt hour when there is excess supply, said elexon ltd., which administers the new u.k. trading system, on its internet site. power trading when the price of power is negative, the trading system effectively pays companies to reduce generation. if a 200 megawatt power station breaks down, and prices in the spot market reach 1,000 pounds a megawatt hour, the station's owner will have to pay 200,000 pounds an hour to meet its supply obligations. owning power stations would allow enron to meet its obligations by boosting generation at the plant rather than by purchasing electricity on the market. the company could also boost output at times when prices are surging, lifting profit. companies owning a single power station, or companies that generate electricity from sources such as wind, are more prone to interruptions and provide enron with possible customers for risk management products to guard against power failures. ``there is huge potential for aggregation of small generators,'' lewis said. ``the provision of risk management is going to be more in demand. this is an opportunity for us to provide services.'' for sale in the u.k., enron employs 13 traders on its london-based electricity desk. the company controls 51 power plants worldwide, and other energy projects in 15 countries on four continents. in the u.k., it owns a 50 percent stake in teesside power station, in the northeast of the country. among u.k. generation assets that may be sold are the fiddler's ferry plant in cheshire and the ferrybridge station in yorkshire, each capable of producing enough power to light 2 million homes. edison mission, a unit of edison international, has said it may sell the stations to focus on its u.s. business. u.k. electric utilities are seeking to make money from trading amid waning profit from their main generation and supply business. the price of generation in the u.k. has tumbled with that of wholesale electricity. wholesale prices dropped 15 percent in the year to march 27, according to regulator ofgem. other companies that may bid for the edison assets include u.s. rival duke energy corp., electricite de france and rwe ag, germany's biggest power company, the sunday telegraph newspaper reported march 16. european markets scottish power streamlines its focus --- uncertainty over water unit, telecom venture clouds u.k. utility's future --- `we have a reasonably low opinion of the company' by andrea chipman dow jones newswires 05/08/2001 the wall street journal europe 12 (copyright (c) 2001, dow jones & company, inc.) london -- after more than a year of lagging earnings, investment missteps and unexpected disasters, u.k. utility scottish power plc is hoping a new strategy to streamline its businesses will signal a more focused period for the company. but it has got its work cut out for it. while investors were cheered by news that its utah-based hunter power plant is back online after a six-month outage that cost the company an estimated $160 million (178.9 million euros), uncertainty over its plans for its southern water unit and apparent commitment to thus, an unprofitable telecommunications venture, are seen as muddling the group's focus. ""it all adds up -- the lack of coherent strategy, quite substantial downgrades and a whole host of noncore businesses that they don't have any natural management flair or expertise in,"" said brian gallagher, a senior fund manager at london-based gartmore investment management, which has gbp 3 million (4.8 million euros) of scottish power shares in its global utilities fund. ""we have a reasonably low opinion of the company."" the company said its pretax profit before goodwill amortization and exceptional items for the year ended march 31 fell 15% to gbp 628 million from gbp 736 million the year before. adjusted earnings per share declined 26% to 30.65 pence from 41.22 pence. the company acknowledged profits have been hit hard by the hunter outage, competition on wholesale and retail markets in the u.k. and strict price controls on its regulated infrastructure businesses. the company's shares are currently trading at 443.25 pence each, down 17% from 533 pence each a year ago. executives say they are restructuring the business into three targeted divisions to capitalize on its traditional strengths in generation and power supply and infrastructure and to expand its overseas activities. ""we've now got a trading and commercial link between generation and supply and the first thing we are doing is putting emphasis on that . . . on growing earnings across that value chain,"" said scottish power's chief executive, ian russell. ""in the u.s., we are focused on cost cutting and on acquiring new businesses."" scottish power's move away from a full multiutility profile -- begun last year with its partial disposal of thus and its withdrawal from an internet banking venture with royal bank of scotland -- toward a more narrowly focused energy business mimics a trend across the industry toward greater specialization. the company is also considering selling southern water, which would allow it to focus even more closely on its power business. yet analysts and investors say they are looking for more details of the company's overall growth strategy from mr. russell, who took over as chief executive last month, and other managers. the toll from months of drift, is evident, they said. indeed, despite its efforts to chart a new road, scottish power appears to be reluctant to acknowledge the failure of some of its noncore ventures. mr. russell said his company remains ""supportive"" of thus, which reported an annual loss of gbp 21.4 million this week, and has no plans to unload its remaining 50% stake in the company. similarly, he said, scottish power hasn't yet made a final decision to dispose of southern water -- which has cut costs under its scottish parent but is increasingly unable to cover its capital expenditure -- although he said the company had received ""a number of offers"" from potential buyers. although he declined to identify any of the bidders, italian energy company enel spa has confirmed its interest. people familiar with the industry said a prompt sale of the water unit looks likely, with some bids already exceeding the gbp 2 billion at which many analysts value the company's combined assets and debt. it is unclear, they said, how southern water or thus would fit into scottish power's new image. ""scottish power sees itself as an international energy company,"" a person familiar with the company said. in a year's time, he added, ""it would be unlikely that southern water and thus would be part of the company."" revenue from the sale of the water unit would also help scottish power pursue its u.s. expansion without extending its 90% debt-to-equity ratio, analysts and investors said. mr. russell declined to comment on reports scottish power is considering buying enron corp.'s oregon-based unit, portland general, but admitted the company would be a logical geographical fit with its pacificorp subsidiary. analysts said scottish power's plans for u.s. growth is likely to be a key part of its energy strategy. ""we like their u.s. strategy, where they've leveraged expertise gained in the highly competitive u.k. market,"" said gareth lewis-davies, head of utilities research at lehman brothers in london. closer to home, competition and the trend toward increased specialization in the power industry may force scottish power to determine whether its business strength lies in asset management or retail and generation. ""strategic decisions need to be made, and i'm not sure if they are going to make them in the near term or not,"" said andrew wright, u.k. utilities analyst at ubs warburg in london. ""they are pretty much involved across the value chain, and i think it remains to be seen which part of the value chain they specialize in, if any."" copyright , 2000 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. india: enron india unit lenders move to solve row-papers. 05/08/2001 reuters english news service (c) reuters limited 2001. bombay, may 8 (reuters) - lenders to u.s. energy giant enron corp's troubled dabhol power company (dpc) project in india may cut interest rates on almost $2 billion of loans to prevent default, business dailies said on tuesday. indian and foreign lenders are willing to help dpc produce power at cheaper cost, but would not hesitate to sue if the stand-off between the government and dpc continues, the news reports said. enron's $2.9 billion project is mired in controversy after the maharashtra state electricity board (mseb) reneged on its commitment to buy all the power produced by the giant plant, saying it is too costly. mseb has also defaulted on monthly payments to dpc for the electricity it has taken, forcing the company's board last month to authorise the management to terminate the contract. that possibility casts a long shadow over the fate of the project's 1,444 mw second phase, which is scheduled to start commercial operation next month. the 740 mw first phase began operating in may 1999. ""all lenders, both indian and offshore, want to see the second phase of the project taking off. we may cut the rates if there is any formal request from either dpc or the government,"" the economic times quoted an unnamed banking source as saying. five indian financial institutions have lent a total $1.4 billion to the project. the five are the industrial development bank of india , state bank of india , the industrial finance corporation of india , icici ltd and canara bank. the lenders are now working overtime to resolve the issue. last week they sent a letter to the indian finance ministry asking it to clear up $48 million in unpaid bills owed to dabhol. but the business line newspaper reported the banks may take legal action if a quick solution is not found. ""our money is caught between two feuding parties....if they continue their hawkish stand, we will have no other option but sue the company, mseb and the government,"" the paper quoted an unnamed banking source as saying. the dispute has already damaged india's image as a safe destination for foreign investment. it suffered another blow on tuesday when the times of india reported that customs officials in bombay have blocked dpc's imports of project equipment due to a dispute over tax rates.

""our money is caught between two feuding parties. one (enron) is saying that it does not agree with the terms of reference of the godbole panel. the other (mseb) says it cannot buy power from dpc unless offered at a lower rate. if these two continue their hawkish stand, we'll have no other go but sue the company, mseb, and the governments,"" institutional sources said. even though the idbi-led consortium is ""hopeful"" of getting all concerned across the table, and talking, top officials admit that it is quite an uphill task. sources told business line that the lenders will do everything in their power to find an amicable solution to the issue. the lenders are also trying to persuade the union government to play a more ""active role."" informal talks are going on regularly between dpc, its lenders and shareholders. since domestic lenders are the ones who stand to lose the most, they are working overtime to persuade everyone involved to amicably arrive at a viable settlement. the state government agrees with this stance of the lending institutions. ""indian lenders can go to court to recover their dues,"" a senior state government official said. ""foreign lenders are covered by the union government counter-guarantee and various other guarantees by the indian financial institutions. so, a burden of over rs 6,000 crore will fall on the indian institutions. it is understandable if they say they will pull us to court,"" he said. he, however, insisted that it was a remote possibility. the official expressed concern over the union government's delay to nominate a representative for the negotiation process. the state government, has selected mr quinton loh, a chinese lawyer, to represent it for arbitration while mseb has appointed mr m.l. pendse, a former mumbai high court judge, he said. enron had issued the centre a notice of negotiation on april 4. ""the process (negotiation) has to be completed within 60 days. a month has gone by and the centre has not yet begun the process of negotiation,"" the official said. the state is, however, waiting for a resolution of the rs 401-crore rebate dispute between the state electricity board and dpc. ""if the matter is settled and mseb's claim, that dpc should pay them rs 401 crore as rebate, is vindicated, dpc will be in no position to contest on any other ground. even if they lose, the monies will have to be paid and the matter will be resolved,"" he said. meanwhile, a senior mseb official said that the board would have a strong defence as it has been regular in its payments to the dpc. interestingly, if the lenders go to court, the two feuding parties - mseb and enron - will be on the same side slugging it out with the institutions. ""the indian lenders can pull us to court. but we have paid, albeit under protest, all dpc bills regularly, except for the disputed december and january bills,"" the mseb official said. he, however, remarked: ""if the lenders believe going to court is a faster way to recover their money..."" - dinesh narayanan - archana chaudhary copyright , 2000 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. inplay northern border completes midwestern gas buy 05/08/2001 the daily deal copyright (c) 2001 the deal llc williams cos - enron corp. - northern border pipeline co. - el paso corp. - midwestern gas transmission - northern border partners lp omaha pipeline operator northern border partners lp said monday it had completed its acquisition of midwestern gas transmission from houston natural gas transporter el paso corp. for $100 million. the purchase closed after the u.s. federal trade commission approved it. midwestern owns and operates a 350 mile natural gas pipeline system extending from portland, tenn., to joliet, ill., with interconnections to seven major pipeline systems in the chicago area, including the northern border pipeline operated by northern border pipeline co., which is 70% owned by nbp. nbp's general partners are owned by houston energy marketing giant enron corp. and tulsa, okla., natural gas company williams cos. -claire poole copyright , 2000 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. customs blocks rs 300cr equipment of dpc vinu lal 05/08/2001 the times of india copyright (c) 2001 the times of india; source: world reporter (tm) mumbai: it's a never-ending tale of woes for enron and this time the city customs has played the role. the customs department has blocked import of equipment belonging to dabhol power company citing differences in payable duty. sources informed that till date, goods worth rs 300 crore have been blocked by the department. the bone of contention arose when the customs department started demanding normal project imports duties for dpc goods, which used to be imported at concessional rates. the department said that the equipment imports pertaining to liquefied natural gas terminal, which includes goods used for setting up storage tank and terminals, and are not used for generating power but for a commercial activity. enron officials, however, declined to comment on this issue. ``for a power project which involves intra-state sale of electricity, project equipment can be imported at concessional duties which works out to 5 per cent customs duty and another 16 per cent counter-vailing duty. but if equipment imported is being used to set up a lng terminal for commercial purposes and not for generating power then the duty structure works out to 58 per cent,'' sources said. the union ministry of power had given concessional import duties for attracting investments in power sector, if power is sold to other states, no duty is applicable. for dabhol, being an intra-state project, the customs duty will be 5 per cent. dpc is setting up a 5 million tonnes lng facility where only 2.1 million tonnes will be used for the dabhol power project and the remaining capacity would be sold to other customers in the region. at present, the civil works are on for the entire capacity which include three storage tanks and terminal facilities. works on two storage tanks are almost complete with a sizeable work left for the third tank and similar works pending for the terminal, which includes the regassification project. though work on the site has been going on a slow pace due to the current controversy, this move will also have an adverse impact on the project completion, sources added. however, sources said that the company has been demanding concessional duty since the lng project is not a separate project but clubbed with the power project and all other benefits, like taxes, are applicable to lng project as well. copyright , 2000 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. bp amoco considers natural-gas terminal in tampa, fla. steve huettel 05/08/2001 krtbn knight-ridder tribune business news: st. petersburg times - florida copyright (c) 2001 krtbn knight ridder tribune business news; source: world reporter (tm) tampa, fla.--energy giant bp is looking into shipping natural gas into the port of tampa, the latest plan in a race among global companies to supply more gas to the booming florida market. an affiliate of bp has options to lease 60 acres at the tip of hooker's point for a terminal where ships three times the length of a football field would unload natural gas cooled into a liquid at minus 256 degrees fahrenheit. the project would include super-cooled storage tanks, a plant to heat the liquid fuel back into gas and a pipeline connecting to commercial customers, especially electric utilities that use gas-fired generators, the company says. port director george williamson says bp officials told him that the terminal would cost about $200-million and take at least four years to win approval from federal, state and local regulators. the company is considering several locations in north america, although tampa is the only one disclosed so far, said bp spokesman daren beaudo in houston. bp's study hasn't gone far enough to discuss construction cost estimates or other details, he said. bp paid the tampa port authority $20,000 for a six-month option on the site and can extend the option another six months for $50,000 more. there are only two active liquefied natural gas terminals in the united states, although energy companies are working to get two others mothballed in 1980 back into service. four big energy companies, including bp, plan to build as many as seven new terminals in the united states, mexico and the caribbean, according to an april report by salomon smith barney. that includes two terminals in the bahamas designed to serve florida. enron wants to run a pipeline 90 miles that will come ashore in broward county. el paso energy won't say how it would transport the gas to florida. forecasters at the state public service commission estimate demand for natural gas will grow an average of 5 percent a year over the next decade. energy companies and analysts say the growth could be twice that much. driving demand is a bevy of new gas-fired power plants and conversions of old plants to run on the clean-burning fuel, said michael schmitz, an analyst with salomon smith barney. liquefied gas from trinidad, venezuela and elsewhere will be needed to augment gas piped from domestic fields, he said. ""many, many of these new power plants are natural gas-fired, and it's tough to see where the big uptick is going to come in u.s. production,"" schmitz said. ""the supply for florida is as tight or tighter than the rest of the country."" while liquefied natural gas makes up only 1 percent of the u.s. gas supply, it is widely used in japan and korea. bp and other companies say they've got an outstanding safety record in shipping and handling the material. liquefied natural gas isn't combustible until it vaporizes and reaches a certain mixture with oxygen. the liquid isn't stored under pressure, so it doesn't leak quickly, bp spokesman neil chapman said. ""it oozes,"" he said. still, plans by williams gas pipeline to reactivate its cove point terminal in lusby, md., has neighbors jittery. schmitz thinks enron and el paso are building in the bahamas to avoid tougher scrutiny from federal regulators and local opposition in south florida. spokesmen for the companies say various factors went into their decisions. forecasters at the state public service commission estimate demand for natural gas will grow an average of 5 percent a year over the next decade. the prospect of a terminal in tampa doesn't alarm peter clark, executive director of tampa baywatch, an environmental group. he notes that ships in tampa bay hold a variety of hazardous cargos. vessels must maintain a 1,000-yard ""clear zone"" from barges carrying anhydrous ammonia and propane. they aren't allowed to pass them in shipping channels. ""it's a matter of being able to transport it in a safe manner,"" clark said. copyright , 2000 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. enron could supply universities with state-subsidized power by david kravets associated press writer 05/07/2001 associated press newswires copyright 2001. the associated press. all rights reserved. san francisco (ap) - enron corp., which was ordered last month to honor its contracts to supply power to california's public universities, has won a key appellate ruling that could cost taxpayers millions. a federal appeals panel said the houston-based energy wholesaler could buy power for the universities from the state's investor-owned utilities, rather than buying it on the expensive ""spot"" power market. enron says it would save the company $12 million a month. but it means the state will have to spend more money buying electricity to supply the universities. since january, california has already spent $5 billion buying electricity for the customers of three ailing utilities that will eventually be repaid by customers and taxpayers. in its thursday ruling made public monday, the 9th u.s. circuit court of appeals overturned a federal judge's april decision that ordered enron to directly supply power to most of the state's universities as part of a long-term agreement with them that expires in march. where enron buys that power makes a huge financial difference to the state under california's power deregulation rules. the state said it could spend - or enron could save - up to $12 million a month. that's because buying last-minute power on the spot market, where enron had been buying the schools' power, costs several times more than what the state can legally collect from ratepayers. since january, the state has bought electricity for the customers of pacific gas and electric co., southern california edison co. and san diego gas and electric co. in an attempt to keep them financially stable as power prices skyrocketed. the state has only been able to retrieve $1 billion from customers of the $5 billion it has spent on electricity buys, said nathan barankin, a spokesman with the attorney general. the state said it would ask the court to reconsider its supply decision. the ruling, barankin said, ""allows enron to perpetuate its scam on california's taxpayers."" that's a position enron vehemently denies. ""we believe, under the way the contract is written, it gives us the right to supply the power or have somebody else source the power for us, such as the utilities,"" said enron spokeswoman peggy mahoney. enron convinced the appeals panel that it should not have to purchase power on the spot market to honor its contract, and instead can make good on its cheap power contract by buying it from the utilities. that means enron will pay substantially less for the electricity through the utilities and will reimburse the universities for possible charges that exceed the contracted price with enron. electricity sold through the utilities is capped under california law and does not reflect the true cost of the power. billions of dollars of undercollected costs is among the main reasons pg&e filed for federal bankruptcy protection early last month. the case is uc regents v. enron energy systems inc., 01-1006. --- copyright , 2000 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. usa: northern border partners buys midwestern gas. 05/07/2001 reuters english news service (c) reuters limited 2001. omaha, neb., may 7 (reuters) - northern border partners lp said it has completed the acquisition of midwestern gas transmission from el paso corp for about $100 million. the midwestern system, a 350-mile natural gas pipeline extending from portland, tenn. to joliet, ill., provides interconnections to seven major pipeline systems in the chicago market area, including the northern border pipeline. the purchase, announced in mid-march, was completed april 30 following approval of the federal trade commission. northern border partners owns a 70 percent general partner interest in northern border pipeline co., a 1,214-mile pipeline system that transports natural gas from the montana-saskatchewan border to markets in the midwestern u.s. the partnership also has gathering systems and processing plants in the powder river, wind river and williston basins in the u.s. rocky mountain region; owns and operates processing plants and gathering pipelines in alberta, canada; and transports coal-water slurry via a pipeline in the southwestern u.s. northern border partners' general partners are units of enron corp. and williams cos. inc. . copyright , 2000 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. enron confirms dpc's meet with indian state panel may 11 05/07/2001 dow jones international news (copyright (c) 2001, dow jones & company, inc.) new delhi -(dow jones)- u.s. energy company enron's (ene) indian unit dabhol power co. will meet the country's maharashtra state government's expert committee appointed with the objective to renegotiate the controversial power purchase agreement with dpc, enron vice president john ambler confirmed to dow jones newswires from houston late monday. in an online statement, ambler who handles enron's international public affairs, said: ""we confirm that dabhol power co. has been invited to meet with the recently formed negotiating committee. as a matter of courtesy we have agreed to meet with them (on may 11). since the purpose of our meeting is to hear out the committee and understand their thoughts, we will not present any proposals."" ""while we have constantly maintained that we are open to continuing a dialogue towards resolving issues, this meeting should in no manner be construed as an open offer from dpc to renegotiate the terms of the contract,"" he added. dabhol has come under fire because of the relatively high cost of its power. critics object to dabhol charging 7.1 rupees ($1=inr46.82) a kilowatt-hour for its power, compared with inr1.5/kwh charged by other suppliers. the $3 billion, 2,184-megawatt dpc project in maharashtra has been mired in financial disputes after the maharashtra state electricity board, its main customer, failed to pay several bills. the project has the largest single foreign investment in india. as reported, a nine-member state committee headed by retired federal home secretary madhav godbole is working toward lowering the dpc's power tariff and allowing the sale of excess power to the federal government or its utilities. a restructuring of the dpc's stakeholding may also be on the agenda. the maharashtra government has asked the committee to try to negotiate a revised agreement within a month. the dpc currently operates a 740-megawatt naphtha plant contributing about 0.7% to india's installed capacity. enron has maintained that work will be completed by the year-end in the second phase of the dabhol project that will add 1,444 mw to its capacity. the plant will switch from naphtha to liquefied natural gas as a fuel source in 2002. texas-based enron has a 65% stake in the dpc and is the project's largest shareholder. other shareholders include the mseb with 15%, and general electric co.

"cc: bcc: are we still considering adding ets-owned generation at one or more of the tw compressor stations in arizona or nm? in case that is still a possibility, let me pass on something we may want to follow up on. i called an old law partner of mine from dc who is now in the generation development business this week to have lunch and catch up. this guy says he has come up with a good formula for getting new generation built fast and cheap. he's got an 80mw nameplate simple cycle project (two frame 6 turbines) under development in utah that he started development on a month ago and is projected to go in service on july 1. pretty quick work compared to other projects i've seen. here's his racket: 1. he gets used, first quality turbines that have been well maintained. his utah turbines are something like 2 year old ge units that he bought from tokyo electric (he said they had 4000 hours on them and were maintained in typical electric utility gold plated style). he didn't say, but i suspect there is no warranty on the units. obviously, this isn't a bold new strategy, but this guy claims to have a good handle on available used equipment. 2. his siting/permitting strategy is to use ""brownfield"" sites--i.e., existing industrial or utility infrastructure is there along with some existing air emissions sources. his utah site is at the magnesium corp. of america plant on the great salt lake. magcorp is an ex-client of mine and i know it is a huge emissions source and has no nimby issues. our compressor sites, in contrast, are not major emissions sites but may have some other things in common with this strategy. 3. here's a mysterious one--he says the financing is backstopped by the site owner (magcorp in his project, potentially us if we do a tw project) but the corporate structure he has designed results in the power plant being treated as a non-controlled, non-affiliated entity for air permitting purposes. that means the power plant emissions are not treated as part of the same emissions source as the host/site. i'm not sure how/whether this works in a tw scenario, but it might be worth looking at. we'd need to make sure that any power plant deal we chase doesn't screw up the timetable on the redrock expansion application at ferc. mkm--if we could preserve the ""separate source"" concept for air permitting purposes, could we even start work on developing a power project soon or would we be better off to wait until we have a ferc certificate in hand?? let me know if there is anything worth pursuing on this. i'm having lunch with this guy on mon. and will probably learn more. the thing he is proudest of is that given the low permitting cost and relatively cheap cost of installed capacity, the project is expected to pay for itself in two months and then generate 100% upside. sounds good to me if its real. df"

(certainly if they are talking with him, this could be an opportunity for us to support, echo and otherwise fortify enron's message points in this area - - i look to kenny and peggy for guidance here). messages have been left with vijay, asking for more specific information. i will follow up with him as directly as i can on monday; since vijay with be in the us, he should now deal with me and/or neil nowlin, my media relations colleague based in the dallas office of bursonmarsteller (accenture's pr counsel). i've attached some background info on vijay (see below); i look forward to your thoughts and comments. cheers darienne director, media relations/resources new york city background bio info on vijay vaitheeswaran: vijay vaitheeswaran the economist vijay vaitheeswaran covers oil for the economist magazine in london. he earned a b.s. in mechanical engineering from m.i.t. and recently was honored with the british energy award for the best public utility submission at the 2001 business journalist of the year awards. (the awards are supported by the corporation of london, the confederation of british industry, the london chamber of commerce and industry and the chartered institute of bankers, sponsored by industry, and judged by prominent journalists, and representatives of non-profit institutions.) eight years ago, the former new yorker went to work at a new job in london. he is now as much a fixture at the economist as the clunky old atex system. vijay is a former mechanical engineer turned brand manager at procter & gamble turned reporter. in 1994, the economist sent him out to mexico to open its first bureau in latin america. he returned in 1998 with a tan, a stash of tequila and fine cigars, and a very bad attitude about frigid england. he's gotten over it, and just recently took on the global environment energy beat, with responsibility for topics ranging from the obvious to agriculture, mining and commodities, as well as the impact of all of these things on economic development. here's a link to his most recent article in the economist a brighter future? the economist, feb 8th 2001 by vijay vaitheeswaran for the better part of a century, governments the world over have been running the power business as a command-and-control monopoly. even in free-market america, most people have been getting their power from stodgy local utilities unencumbered by competition. this method has its merits: most of the rich world is now wired up. but it conspicuously failed in the developing countries, where over 2 billion people still have no access to electricity. and now, as concerns about the reliability and cleanliness of grid power grow, its limitations are becoming more apparent in the industrial world, too. this message is for the designated recipient only and may contain privileged or confidential information. if you have received it in error, please notify the sender immediately and delete the original. any other use of the email by you is prohibited. <embedded picture (device independent bitmap)>"

"px `don't get it' cc: bcc: calif eob official says iso, px `don't get it' 09/21/2000 dow jones energy service (copyright (c) 2000, dow jones&company, inc.) los angeles -(dow jones)- the executive director of california's electricity oversight board stressed to the state's power exchange and independent system operator to provide detailed information to the state agency before making changes to their market structure. in an e-mail obtained by dow jones newswires and sent monday to iso and calpx officials, eob executive director gary heath wrote he was unaware that the iso had engaged in a new ""seasonal super peak day of market"" to purchase forward power tuesday from santa clara-based automated power exchange. the calpx and apx have developed a proposal that would allow its customers to power in hour blocks directly to the iso weekdays. the iso had filed with federal regulators last week seeking authority to make such purchases, but apparently the electricity oversight board was left in the dark. ""no one seems to get it,"" reads the email written by heath and sent to iso and px officials. ""no more surprises from the iso, px, etc. this is not the time to change any procedures without notice to the eob... you file with the (federal energy regulatory commission) seeking approval of the iso's ability to buy in forwards and you have no sense to run this by the state before you file..."" ""we are in troubling times,"" heath's e-mail states. ""both corporations must begin to realize that what was created by the state can be undone."" neither of the parties mentioned in the e-mail would comment on the issues. the iso and px are currently the target of a state audit spearheaded by state sen. steve peace, d-el cajon, who believes merging the two corporations will help california's troubled deregulated market work better for consumers. sen. peace, in past interviews, has threatened to dismantle the current iso structure and have the eob control the iso markets. heath also wrote his board was upset that the federal bonneville power administration has managed to save california from rolling blackouts, referred to as a stage three emergency, ""at the last minute."" ""i've got the administration on my butt wanting to know what's going on with bpa and we can't get a straight answer from the iso... no more bs from the iso,"" the e-mail states. furthermore, heath stated the iso must run any proposed changes or additions to its market structure before the eob before filing with federal regulators as well as providing the eob information on power plant outages. ""when we ask for information on outages... i expect the iso to fully disclose to us,"" the e-mail says.

"this is certainly a tough one. we go to great lengths to avoid regulation here and have been fairly successful to date. we do have some oversight from the federal energy regulatory commission (ferc) regarding our power trading and pipeline activities and local state regulators keep an eye on our purely intrastate pipeline activities, but for the most part we are unsupervised. if it helps, we conduct our derivative trading operations in accordance with commodity futures trading commission (cftc) regulations (but that's just complying with the eligible swap participant and trade option exemption rules). it is true we are a member of the nymex and subject to their rules but they relate almost exclusively to trading on the nymex. it might be more helpful to talk to the guys in london about our sfa regulatory status. we have quite a bit more supervision there than we do here in the states. david 06/13/2000 02:56 am cc: robert sara paul mark, we are attempting to get a broad approval to trade any types of products in australia through enrononline. (currently our ability to trade products other electricity through enrononline using standardised documentation is not beyond doubt). what the australian regulators are looking for is for us to point to a regulatory oversight in the us of enron's trading activities. they hopefully then will back off. particularly they want us to demonstrate there are some prudential requirements enron corp. needs to meet in respect of trading activities. pardon my complete ignorance but are there any? would membership of nymex be relevant? --------------------- forwarded by david minns/enron_development on 06/13/2000 06:19 pm --------------------------- ""farrell, scott"" on 06/13/2000 06:29:38 pm cc: ""james, martin"" mallesons stephen jaques confidential communication david i have just had another call from asic (alan worseley and tim hardman). it seems that there is a single significant policy concern for the asic policy committee. this arises because asic believes that a significantly wider range of sophisticated counterparties will be interested in the enrononline products (such as weather and credit) than those that are interested in australian electricity derivatives. as a result, asic is not able to simply ""transfer-across"" its approval of eaf under the electricity declaration without separate consideration as to how eaf can meet the prudential regulation criteria specified in ps 70. they have asked for further information in this regard. obviously i mentioned the presence of the enron corp guarantee. however, asic may require something further, such as evidence of procedures in place to prevent an enron failure. ps 70 states in this regard (in paragraphs 46 and 47): ""the asc considers that providers of safe harbour market facilities should be subject to regulation which at least sets minimum capital standards and ensures regular reporting against them. this is because the financial stability of a facility provider is a crucial factor in the stability of any market conducted by that provider. this will ensure that risks associated with the conduct of a safe harbour market are monitored. standard setting and monitoring will contribute to the continued financial stability of the facility provider. if the facility provider is a significant participant in other markets, it will also help prevent any adverse consequences for those markets if the facility provider fails. regulatory supervision of this kind may occur in a number of ways. for the purposes of the asc's policy, it is not the identity of a particular supervisory authority that is important, but the fact that the organisation is subject to supervision which produces the results mentioned in para 46. regulatory supervision will meet this test only if the capital standards which it imposes on an organisation take into account the organisation's derivatives market activities."" the following paragraphs are also explanatory, particularly as they refer to certain us licensees. are any enron entities subject to prudential or similar regulation due to the licences/authorisations which they hold? this could be a useful starting point. they also mentioned that there may be difficulty in achieving the 23 june timetable. however, the focus of the discussion was the policy issue rather than timing. best regards scott farrell senior associate mallesons stephen jaques sydney direct line (61 2) 9296 2142 fax (61 2) 9296 3999"

"copyright , the sacramento bee dan walters: a power crisis imperils davis (published nov. 26, 2000) gov. gray davis would appear to be living a charmed political life. california's economy is soaring, the state's tax coffers -- and davis' own re-election treasury -- are bulging, voters are in a complacent mood, and there have been none of the devastating disasters that plagued the state during the early 1990s. there is, however, a very dark cloud casting a shadow over davis' governorship: the prospect of rolling blackouts as demand for electric power exceeds supply, accompanied by tremendous increases in californians' power bills. and how davis handles this incipient crisis could be the hallmark of his first term -- and, potentially, a re-election issue in 2002. san diego utility customers were hit hard last summer as their local utility emerged from the mandatory rate freeze imposed by the state's 1996 utility deregulation scheme. davis and the legislature responded, in effect, by buying some time. they enacted legislation rolling back power bills temporarily, but leaving it unclear whether ratepayers, taxpayers, san diego gas and electric co. or power suppliers would eventually eat the wholesale costs that led to the spikes. clearly, davis was hoping that the federal energy regulatory commission (ferc) would step in and force the suppliers to refund hundreds of millions of dollars to sdg&e and its ratepayers. and that, davis and other politicians hoped, would also forestall a similar, but much larger crisis looming for customers of southern california edison and pacific gas and electric co., the state's two largest private utilities. the two are still operating under the rate freeze, but have acquired at least $5 billion in unanticipated wholesale power costs that they want to pass on to their ratepayers. politically, ferc intervention would be the most palatable of the alternatives because it would place the financial onus on mostly out-of-state corporations that have little political standing. california politicians have been demonizing the power suppliers, saying they took advantage of the deregulation program's auction process to drive up costs far beyond reason. the problem for davis and others is that ferc is not cooperating, pointedly refusing to intervene in a way that the governor wanted. davis ripped into the ferc response during a hearing earlier this month, accusing it of ""gutting (california's) ability to protect consumers"" and proposing ""new and completely untried market rules, making guinea pigs of california consumers in yet another reckless deregulation experiment."" davis wants to appoint himself as the california utility customer's best friend, hinting that he may lead a ""ratepayer revolt"" if ferc continues to refuse to order refunds from suppliers and new price controls. but it's unclear what he can do concretely, since he's on record as approving the overall thrust of deregulation and since many of the business interests he has cultivated to obtain his re-election funds have benefited from having power suppliers compete for their business. doing nothing could mean that when southern california edison and pg&e emerge from the rate freeze, they will raise rates dramatically, just as davis is seeking re-election in 2002. the utilities seem to be offering davis a deal: allow them to begin raising rates now to recover their ""stranded costs"" for wholesale power and they will avoid sticker-shock raises in 2002. another option would be for davis to spend some of the state's billions of surplus dollars to either ease the impact on ratepayers or put the state into the power supply business itself. the only certainty is that unless ferc reverses itself, davis will remain on the hook for whatever happens -- the sort of unpredictable situation that he hates to encounter. dan walters' column appears daily except saturday. mail: p.o. box 15779, sacramento, 95852; phone: ; fax: ; e-mail:"

assume roles centered around ""regulators,"" ""power marketers,"" the present ""investor owned utility"" and the ""town"" itself. a town meeting will be convened in which each entity is allowed to present their issues in an effort to persuade municipal decision-makers that theirs is the best option. embedded in the exercise is the regulatory and operational framework that is built into the modules leading up to this participatory segment. frequent references to the basic materials provided to the workshop participants will be encouraged in the process of moderating discussions that the workshop facilitators will implement. *congestion management congestion management is one of the most critical components of ercot implementation. a number of approaches exist for pricing electricity during periods of high demand. each methodology bears important consequences for both providors and customers. workshop participants will participate in construction of a virtual transmission grid and experiment with different methods of managing congestion. 4:00 re-cap, q&a instructors ms. dottie anderson ms. anderson has over 19 years experience in the energy industry with extensive experience in

"today, enron hosted a conference call to give investors a current overview = of the company. here's an update of what we discussed during the call. we told investors that we're doing everything we can to protect their inter= ests and to regain their confidence. our focus remains on our credit qualit= y, balance sheet and liquidity, which are essential for our continued succe= ss and expansion of our wholesale businesses. it took more than a few weeks to get where we are today. here's a snapshot = of significant events that led to our current situation: -- in hindsight, we definitely made some very bad investments in our non-co= re businesses over the past several years. those include investments in azu= rix, india and brazil. they have performed far worse that we could have eve= r imagined when we made these investments; -- because of these bad investments, we've become over-leveraged as a compa= ny. the negative impact of those investments was exacerbated through the ex= tensive use of debt capital both on and off our balance sheet; -- we also entered into related party transactions that led to a loss of in= vestor confidence, which has been very damaging; -- we've been criticized for our lack of transparency and our hard-to-under= stand financial and operating disclosures;

"pavel, a follow-up on our discussion concerning the wisdom of imf recommendations for russia. vince ---------------------- forwarded by vince j kaminski/hou/ect on 04/18/2000 08:03 am --------------------------- on 04/15/2000 10:14:28 am cc: sound the alarm economist james stiglitz rips washington's ""market bolsheviks"" by james north when the asian economic crisis started to bite deeply, during the second half of 1997, joseph stiglitz recalls that his children were studying the holocaust. each day, he went off to his job as chief economist and no. 3 man at the world bank, where he and his colleagues had come up with a consensus of how to contain the spreading crisis. each day, he got increasingly frustrated as the bank's proposals were overruled by its sister organization, the international monetary fund, influenced strongly by what stiglitz calls the imf's ""largest shareholder,"" the u.s. treasury department. especially frightening to stiglitz was the imf's rescue plan for indonesia, east asia's most populous country after china. the fund directed the indonesian government to cut social spending and raise interest rates, policies designed to draw panicked overseas investors back into the country. but stiglitz argued that sudden cuts, particularly in food and kerosene subsidies, could trigger social unrest in the fragile island nation, and that the violence might take an ugly ethnic turn. the chinese minority there had already started to worry. ""my kids were writing school papers about people who remained silent during the holocaust in europe,"" stiglitz remembered recently. ""so you ask yourself the question: 'do you remain silent and play the system, or do you speak out?' why have a job with responsibility if you don't speak out?"" the imf imposed its plan, and just as stiglitz and the world bank had predicted, ethnic conflict swept across indonesia, leaving hundreds dead. by then, however, the economist was speaking out on indonesia and other international economic matters -- an action that earned him the enmity of lawrence summers, now secretary of the treasury, then in a lesser role at the agency, and other officials at the treasury and the imf. their hostility, he asserts, led to his departure from the world bank earlier this year. today, from the outside, stiglitz is increasing his criticism of the u.s. treasury/imf policy toward asia, latin america and russia, which is still fundamentally unchanged despite the great scare of 1997-98. stiglitz himself may not join the expected protests this week in washington at the imf/world bank annual meetings. but the intellectual rigor and creativity that has put him on just about everyone's short list for the nobel prize in economics will provide powerful support for the critics. the malcontent when stiglitz left the world bank, press accounts described him as ""a malcontent,"" ""a great nuisance"" and ""a scourge of the washington establishment."" in person, however, he seems pleasant and enthusiastic, not sour or contentious. even when asked about his no. 1 opponent, lawrence summers, he was never hostile, maintaining a kind of bemused detachment about the treasury secretary; he chuckled when he recollected how summers ""went ballistic"" after one of his critical speeches. joseph stiglitz's disagreements with the so-called washington consensus are intellectual and not personal. he recognizes that he leans to the liberal side of the spectrum, but he also insists that his views are not based on sentiment, but on what he calls ""good economic science."" stiglitz: ""do you remain silent and play the system, or do you speak out?"" take, for instance, the world bank's response as the asian crisis unfolded. after thailand's devaluation in july 1997, the bank started to get data showing that the country's financial crisis was triggering a depression -- a severe downturn that would soon spread to indonesia, south korea and hong kong. to stiglitz, who had earlier been chairman of president clinton's council of economic advisers, the pattern looked familiar. ""i was approaching it much as i would if i were advising the president of the united states, recommending stimulatory policies to counter the decline,"" he remembers. instead, the treasury/imf in tandem overruled the bank and did the precise opposite, directing the beleaguered asian countries, as a condition for getting the bailout emergency loans, to raise interest rates and to reduce government spending, including the all-important food and fuel subsidies. today, stiglitz still cannot hide his astonishment at these contractionary policies. the washington consensus argued that the measures were necessary to restore overseas investor confidence, stabilize falling exchange rates and attract capital back into the afflicted countries. but he points out that their economic models were far too narrow, and therefore doomed to fail. for example, the treasury/imf strategy ignored the potential for bankruptcies. the sky-high interest rates forced even sound companies in thailand and indonesia to the wall, which wasn't the best way to re-inspire foreign investors. at the same time, the sharp cuts in government spending stimulated violence across indonesia, which did not build confidence overseas, either. stiglitz insists that ""these political and social concerns are not outside the economic model."" he knew that over the years, unrest had been frequent in the developing world following the imposition of austerity plans. indeed, austerity-inspired uprisings are routinely called ""imf riots."" but when he raised his doubts, within channels, he says, ""it was like hitting your head against the wall."" stiglitz has other pungent criticisms of the washington consensus: he questions the treasury/imf insistence that emerging nations end restrictions on capital flows. he points out that vulnerability to hot money can worsen crises, emphasizing that some countries, such as china, have achieved significant rates of growth without making their currencies fully convertible. he continues to criticize western policy toward russia. he argues that the crash privatization program, in a country with no working democratic, legal or financial regulatory system, created a corrupt new oligarchy that blocks economic growth. he is particularly biting about the imf's 1998 russian bailout. ""was this a good investment?"" he asks. ""you put in $6 billion ... that enables the oligarchs to take out $6 billion in capital flight the next day. clearly the country is worse off, and everybody knew it was going to happen."" he has strong objections to the imf's policy of ""conditionality"" -- of making loans to countries contingent on far-reaching internal changes. ""of course, any lender will need evidence the loan can be repaid,"" he recognizes. ""but the conditionalities the imf imposes have gone well beyond anything required for repayment."" now that stiglitz is outside the system, he's expanding his critique. he will divide his time between the brookings institution in washington, teaching at stanford and working on a book about his experiences on the inside. not surprisingly, he comes down hardest on the u.s. treasury/imf policymakers. they embody what stiglitz calls ""the theory of escalating commitment."" by that he means, ""the cost of continuing mistakes is borne by others, while the cost of admitting mistakes is borne by yourself."" finally, he asserts, treasury/imf bureaucrats are following the dictates of an ideology, not testing economic models in a scientific way. stiglitz uses the term ""market bolsheviks"" to describe the advisers who helped bring russia to its economic knees in the 1990s -- people who believed fervently in a rigid fundamentalist doctrine and tried to force an entire society to conform to it, just as their central planning predecessors had done back in lenin's day. the economist savors one final irony. imf policy makers never apply their anti-state orthodoxy to their own organization. ""intellectual consistency,"" he says, ""should lead them to ask themselves, 'if we believe that government bureaucrats are always incompetent, then why are we an exception? he points out that the spread of democracy, accountability, good governance and transparency are applauded around the world, at least in theory, and asks: ""is it right for an international organization to be the instrument of political change? those of us who are committed to democracy are very uncomfortable with a bunch of international bureaucrats playing the role of god. sometimes, they may play the role in the right way, but they can also overturn democratically elected governments."" in a sense, joseph stiglitz resembles another economist, who worked for the british treasury and attended the 1919 versailles peace negotiations after the first world war. john maynard keynes was so disturbed at what he saw there that he resigned his post and wrote the economic consequences of the peace, an impassioned polemic that eerily predicted that the harsh and punitive economic settlement the allies had imposed on germany would create terrible unrest and ""sow the decay of the whole civilized life of europe."" ""what was great about keynes was the combination of someone who used analytic powers but who didn't distance himself from the human cost,"" stiglitz observes. ""during the vietnam war, we tried to distance ourselves by talking about body counts. in economics, we talk about unemployment rates, so we don't see the people. the challenge is, how do you remain analytically honest, but not lose the human dimension?"" ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ --"

"fyi -----original message----- sent: monday, november 05, 2001 10:09 am during this critical time, it is imperative that our management team remain focused on our business and continue to address the challenges currently facing our company. for that reason, i have decided to postpone the enron management conference. the conference will now be held friday, february 22 - saturday, february 23, 2002 at the westin la cantera resort in san antonio. while the saturday meeting allows some enron executives who cannot be away from the office during business hours to attend the management conference for the first time, i also recognize that it requires many of you to forfeit additional personal time on behalf of enron. i truly appreciate your sacrifice and i sincerely encourage your attendance. the new agenda, while still being finalized, will be abbreviated but every bit as informative and worthwhile as previously planned. we'll be in touch soon with more details. regards, ken lay"

i recieved the same document. if you would distribute it to the committee that would be appreciated. i would think we might want to discuss it at the board meeting prior to setting up another meeting with eei. what do you think? i can see pros and cons of meeting with eei prior to the next board meeting. depending on the strawman i feel we are beginning to lose key support from the board to work this matter. bill we need to get the board to continue to follow him if we are to make progress.

"-----original message----- sent: monday, october 29, 2001 9:45 am part 2 recruiting roundup the status of three outstanding players texas is recruiting is rather murky at this time. lb garnet smith of arlington lamar is committed to texas, but is setting up visits to oklahoma (he was once committed to the sooners) and several other schools. wr robert timmons of flower mound marcus committed to florida and lb michael williams of lindale committed to oklahoma last week, but then they both decommitted. williams attended texas a&m's game saturday and plans to come to take an official visit to texas the december 14 weekend. * * * * the longhorns' 16 commitments include nine players who are listed on one or more national top 100 teams. they are wr marquis johnson, 6-3, 200, 4.48, of centennial high school in champaign, illinois; de chase pittman, 6-5, 263, 4.7, of shreveport evangel; lb garnet smith, 6-3, 221, 4.54, of arlington lamar, dts sonny davis, 6-1, 320, 5.0, of gulf coast jc in mississippi and formerly of austin lanier, earl anderson, 6-4, 270, 4.8, of san marcos, lyle sendlein, 6-4, 260, 4.8, of scottsdale chaparral, the two-time defending class 4a champion in arizona; ols brett valdez, 6-4, 310, 5.1, of brownwood and neale tweedie, 6-5, 260, 4.9, of allen; and te david thomas, 6-3, 210, 4.6, of wolfforth frenship. davis made all of the top national lists last year. however, he injured a knee and has undergone surgery, and his coach at gulf coast jc says he has a lot of academic ground to cover to graduate. the other longhorn pledges are dt tully janszen, 6-4, 255, 4.78, of keller; lbs brian robison, 6-3, 245, 4.6, of splendora and marcus myers, 6-3, 220, 4.5, of pflugerville connally; wr dustin miksch, 6-0, 165, 4.4, of round rock westwood; qb billy don malone, 6-2 1/2, 185, 4.7, of paris north lamar; db matt melton, 5-11, 190, 4.43 of tyler, and rb/ath clint haney, 5-11, 190, 4.27 of smithson valley. * * * * the longhorns will give about 10 to 12 more scholarships and i think most of them will be awarded to members of a 20-player group that includes qb vincent young of houston madison, rbs albert hardy of galena park and selvin young of houston jersey village, wrs timmons, biren ealy of cypress falls and anthony wright of klein forest, te eric winston of midland lee, ols justin blalock of plano east and tony ugoh of spring westfield, des bryan pickryl of jenks, okla., larry dibbles of lancaster and travis leitko of the woodlands, dts rodrique wright of alief hastings, marco martin of mesquite and kasey studdard of highlands ranch, colo., lbs aaron harris of north mesquite and lindale's williams, and dbs edorian mccullough of north garland, brodney pool of houston westbury and ricky wilson of port arthur lincoln. if the longhorns finish strong, they have a very good chance to get the four top players on my 25-man ""difference-maker"" list. they already have no. 4 in earl anderson and they have very good shots at no. 1 wright, no. 2 young and no. 3 dibbles. if pikryl lived in texas, he would be in my top 5, and he says texas is the leader right now. he took his official visit the weekend of the colorado game. the longhorns might take a kicker if they find one who is consistent at kicking off into the end zone. trey decarlo at carrollton creekview is the best i've seen this year at booting them deep. college kickers start five yards farther back but decarlo's kicks usually carry out of the end zone. * * * * interesting recruiting tidbit: the longhorns lost their mystique for many years, but there are a few signs they are getting it back. consider this item in last friday's chicago tribune about ut pledge marquis johnson, a top 50 national recruit from champaign cen-tennial,under a brief column entitled ""8 players to watch: ""anytime texas comes to illinois to recruit a player, you know he's something special."" subscribe to the e-mail/fax to get year-round football & recruiting scoops ! save big as an internet subscriber ! whether you live close to austin or far away, the true orange e-mail/fax service is the way to keep up with longhorn football and longhorn recruiting - instantly. it has about 110 to 120 timely e-mail/faxes a year, primarily about football and football recruiting. to subscribe, send your check to true orange, box 26530, austin, texas 78755, and copy or clip the coupon below and fill in the blanks. if you want it mailed, or by e-mail, just include the right numbers. o i'm enclosing $99 for the 99-fax package for the next year o i'm enclosing $130 (an $11 saving) to renew my subscription to true orange and to subscribe to the 99 faxes. o i'm enclosing $79 for the 99-fax package for the next year by e-mail (a $20 saving) o here's $110 to renew my subscription to true orange and to subscribe to the 99 faxes by e-mail (a $31 saving) o here's $99 to subscribe to true orange via the internet and to subscribe to the 99 faxes by e-mail (a $42 saving) name fax no.

texas a&m 16-10; nebraska, 48-7; oklahoma, 33-17, and texas tech, 63-19. qb greg cicero, a former longhorn, is the bears' main offensive threat as you can see from the teams' respective national rankings below, baylor has had trouble running the ball. there are 115 division 1 teams playing football and the bears are 113th in rushing and also 113th in total offense and 112th in scoring. the baylor defense has been tough at times, particulary in the 16-10 loss to a&m. but this is a game the longhorns should win easily. look for rb cedric benson to extend his ut true freshman record of three straight 100-yard rushing games to four and look for qb chris simms to have a great day. it also should be a good day for the longhorn defense to get back in the top 10 nationally. here's how the teams compare statistically (national rank in parenthesis): texas baylor offense (42) 169.1 rushing avg.

""we have three really good guards,"" he said. * * * * qb chris simms climbed into fourth place on the longhorn list for touchdown passes. he has 28 after throwing four against missouri. he passed shea morenz and bobby layne, who had 24 each. peter gardere is in third place with 37. major applewhite holds the school record with 58 career touchdown passes. * * * * wr roy williams had five receptions and a touchdown pass to move into 10th and 5th places, respectively, in the ut career charts."

''i can't really tell you who, because there are hundreds i've met with,'' he said. administration officials also said that they wanted to keep private the list of those they met with to encourage the free flow of ideas. still, they said that they had talked with a broad range of interested parties. in a recent interview, vice president dick cheney said: ''the staff of our energy task force has spent time with folks from various pieces, parts, of the industry. we've also spent time with the environmentalists. i spent a lot of time with members of congress, listening to them, both parties, on energy. so the idea that somehow only the energy industry has access just simply isn't true.'' but last month, two democrats on capitol hill challenged the secrecy of the process surrounding the task force, which has met eight times in the last 90 days. david s. addington, counsel to the vice president, responded that it did not have to provide information about the process because all of the staff members are federal employees. in addition, environmental groups have requested documentation about task force meetings under the freedom of information act, but so far those have been denied. democrats and environmentalists say the process was tilted heavily toward the coal, gas and oil industries and point out that the energy industry is one of the biggest contributors to political campaigns, giving $64 million last year, three-fourths of it to republicans. among those who said they felt shut out was the consumer federation of america, the nation's largest consumer-advocacy group. howard metzenbaum, a democrat and former senator from ohio who is now chairman of the group, said, ''the energy crisis is first and foremost a price crisis affecting consumers. ''it's an incredible insult to the consumers of this country that, to the best of my knowledge, none of the consumer organizations were invited to the meetings or otherwise participated,'' he said. juleanna glover weiss, mr. cheney's spokeswoman, said no invitations were issued and groups had to request meetings. ''we didn't invite anybody to meet with us,'' she said. the leaders of about two dozen environmental groups had asked to see mr. cheney, whose office turned down their requests. instead, midlevel staff members from the groups met with mr. lundquist and ms. knutson. alys campaigne, legislative director of the national resources defense council, said that that meeting lasted about 40 minutes but that the size of the group inhibited substantive policy discussion. ''we asked who the deputies were on different issues so we could have more in-depth conversations, and they wouldn't tell us,'' she said. ''they said, 'just send us paper, we'll take a look at it.' the meeting felt like window dressing for us, but they got to check off the box that they consulted with stake-holders.'' mr. lundquist said he viewed his meeting with the environmental groups as ''a good conversation.'' some of the industry representatives who did get audiences with the vice president said the task force's deliberations seemed a mystery to them, too. john grasser, a spokesman for the national mining association, said: ''we've probably had as much input as anybody else in town.'' but, he added, ''all we know is what we read in the paper. this is a tight-lipped process. i have to take my hats off to them -- they've been able to keep a lid on it.'' richard s. shapiro, senior vice president of the enron corporation, a major republican contributor and the nation's largest trader of wholesale electricity and natural gas, said top executives from his firm spent half an hour with mr. cheney, but he could not tell how much this may have influenced the final report. ''energy issues are a very high priority, and we've had the opportunity to provide some input into the process,'' mr. shapiro said. ''but it's been difficult to get input in the task force. other consumer groups have been weighing in with perspectives. it's not an open-hearing setting.'' tom kuhn, head of the edison electric institute, the utility lobbying group, and a friend of the president's since they were classmates at yale, saw the process as relatively open. ''the task force put out the word they were open to input,'' he said in an interview. he said that his group sent them reports and that some executives met briefly with mr. cheney. given all of their interaction with so many groups, mr. lundquist denied that the process had been secretive. ''i don't think that's fair,'' he said. ''there's been no attempt to make it a secret process. all it's been is an effort to work on and put out good policy.'' copyright , 2000 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. texaco may build a facility to regassify liquefied natural gas offshore louisiana by alexei barrionuevo staff reporter of the wall street journal 05/16/2001 the wall street journal b4 (copyright (c) 2001, dow jones & company, inc.) texaco inc., joining a growing list of companies looking at ways to import more natural gas, said it is considering building a terminal in the gulf of mexico that would regassify liquefied natural gas. while other companies have looked at building land-based lng terminals, texaco, based in white plains, n.y., is considering going offshore. the facility would be constructed in shallow waters off louisiana and make use of texaco's extensive offshore pipeline system. the system's spare capacity has grown in recent years as the gulf of mexico's natural-gas production has declined. cooling natural gas to a point where it liquefies greatly condenses the gas and allows it to be shipped by tanker over long distances. currently, the u.s. only has four lng receiving terminals, two of which have been mothballed for more than 15 years. until this year, lng was considered too expensive for the u.s. market, which relies on lng for less than 2% of total natural gas supply. but with natural-gas prices averaging about twice what they were in 1999, the owners of the mothballed terminals are bringing them back and a flurry of companies have announced plans to build new terminals on both the east and west coasts. the companies include el paso corp., enron corp., phillips petroleum co. and chevron corp., which has agreed to buy texaco in a pending deal. texaco is initially considering a terminal designed to process about one billion cubic feet of gas per day. the facility's capacity could later be doubled, depending on natural-gas demand in the u.s. ""the u.s. demand for natural gas continues to increase at a significant pace, demonstrating the need for clean burning fuels for power generation, industrial fuels and residential markets,"" said robert a. solberg, president of texaco's commercial development business unit. from the proposed louisiana terminal the natural gas would be fed into several interstate pipeline systems, as well as the henry hub futures pricing point in south louisiana, which is operated by sabine pipeline co., a texaco subsidiary. texaco said the proposed terminal could be up and running in four to five years. while the company said it is still evaluating the terminal's cost, other companies have said land-based facilities would each cost about $300 million to $400 million. texaco expects its feasibility study to be done within six months. copyright , 2000 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. may 16, 2001 houston chronicle briefs: houston & state enron to drop suit against ngx enron corp. agreed to provide natural-gas pricing information to ngx canada and drop a $64.6 million suit against the canadian gas exchange. houston-based enron sued ngx in november after the internet exchange, a unit of the company that owns the stockholm stock exchange, changed providers of its gas-pricing data and didn't include trades on enrononline, enron's internet exchange, when calculating gas-price indexes. calgary-based ngx agreed to include enrononline trades in its calculation of its alberta gas price indices by august, enron spokesman eric thode said. the property report plots & ploys by peter grant 05/16/2001 the wall street journal b12 (copyright (c) 2001, dow jones & company, inc.) [what's brewing in the real estate market] bright spot fueled by a strong energy sector, the houston office market is outperforming the rest of the country. while many cities saw office vacancy rise in the first quarter, the downtown vacancy rate in houston dropped to 6.26% from 6.65% at the end of last year, according to cb richard ellis. expanding companies include enron corp., reliant resources inc., dynegy inc. and other energy companies that have been profiting from the deregulation of the electricity business. houston also has been benefiting from consolidation in the oil and gas industry. giants like exxon mobil corp. and anadarko petroleum corp., which acquired union pacific resources last year, have relocated divisions to the city. rents in the hottest submarkets are continuing to increase, according to will penland, head of cb's houston office. ""we're at levels we haven't seen since the late 1970s,"" he says. all this is good news for the three developers that have projects underway downtown. indeed, crescent real estate equities has leased over 70% of the space in 5 houston center, a 27-story building that's still more than one year away from opening. ""it's a very good time to be in houston,"" says crescent chief executive john goff. to sell or not to sell the sales market is continuing to slow as the gap widens between asking prices and what buyers are willing to pay. in the first quarter, about $11.6 billion of property traded hands, down 11% from the same period in 2000, according to granite partners. many sellers are choosing to refinance, an option made especially attractive by declining interest rates. for example, a group led by emmes & co. just refinanced the 21-building meadows business park outside of baltimore for $40 million after failing to get its price of about $55 million. the three-year floating rate loan with cdc mortgage capital inc. was brokered by insignia/esg capital advisors. s. lawrence davis, an emmes partner, notes that the $40 million is well in excess of the $35 million the group invested into the property. ""we recognize at the moment it's not the appropriate time to sell,"" he says. hoop dreams in the mid-1980s, city officials in springfield mass., convinced the naismith basketball hall of fame to move to a forlorn riverfront urban renewal site. but the stores, restaurants and hotels that city officials said would follow never materialized. ""not a darn thing happened,"" says michael downey, president of the o'connell group, a consultant to the museum. despite this history, the hall is giving springfield a second chance. now rising a short distance from the existing facility is a new, larger hall of fame that's scheduled to open next year. once again government officials are promising that numerous other projects will follow. but this time the museum has reason to be confident. the city and state agreed to put up $70 million of the project's $109 million cost, after the museum threatened to move to orlando, fla. a new tourist center already is being built on the site and the picknelly family, which owns peter pan bus lines, is set to break ground soon on a hilton garden inn and pizzeria uno chicago bar & grill. there's even talk of converting the shuttered 110-year-old county jail on the site into an aquarium or some other tourist attraction to complement the hall. one possibility the locals are joking about: using it as a hall of shame where lousy referees could be incarcerated. ""i'm sure there would be a number of players who would support that,"" says thomas mccolgan, the city's economic development director. price reduction after months of negotiations, philadelphia's berwind property group has signed a binding contract to acquire the barbizon hotel from ian schrager. but the price of $96 million is about $4 million less than what was being discussed at the end of last year, a reflection of the softening sales market, people with knowledge of the deal say. berwind plans to add the 306-room property to its melrose chain of high-end hotels. copyright , 2000 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. the americas: energy worries throw the spotlight on chilean policy financial times; may 16, 2001 by raymond colitt and mark mulligan an energy crisis in brazil and the threat of a capacity shortfall in chile has thrown the spotlight on government policy on tariffs and competition, and drawn pressure from the multinational groups that control private-sector generation in south america. both cases also highlight the dangers of over-reliance on hydroelectric generation in countries where rainfall can vary widely year to year. low rainfall in chile in 1998, for example, deprived the hydraulic plants that serve the country's populous southern half of melted snow from the andes, plunging santiago and other urban centres into darkness during four months of rationing. the crisis exacerbated a recession in 1999, when growth dropped into negative territory for the first time in 16 years. industry leaders warn of a repeat in 2003, unless generators are encouraged to invest in new thermal plants with tariffs - or node prices - which reflect the increased costs of natural gas and other combustibles. ""what we need is more thermal capacity,"" says andres gluski, chief executive of aes-owned gener, chile's second-largest generator and the third-biggest in the region. ""if we simply build more hydro plants we end up with the same problem that brazil is experiencing at the moment,"" he said. in brazil, the government is preparing a rationing programme that could force a 15-20 per cent reduction in consumption over the next few months, and shave a percentage point from gross domestic product for the year. although drought in the country - which relies on water for 90 per cent of generation - is blamed for the crisis, industry leaders and experts say lack of investment by the state, which still controls 80 per cent of capacity, and the slow pace of privatisation are the main underlying problems. ""of course the crisis could have been avoided - it has been in the making for years,"" said mauricio tolmasquim, energy expert at federal university in rio de janeiro. he says that while consumption has grown 50 per cent in the past decade, generating capacity has increased only 35 per cent. the government estimates that brazil needs 25,000mw of new capacity over the next five years, but companies are holding back on investment because current tariffs makes new projects unprofitable. enron, the us energy group, has put two of its three energy projects on hold. ""we're in a capital-intensive business, in which the recovery of investment requires a long period of time,"" said alfredo llorente, president of enersis, the latin american holding company for endesa of spain, the region's largest electricity investor. ""therefore it is essential to know what rules are going to apply over the long term."" despite growth in electricity demand in chile averaging about 7 per cent since 1996, there has been little new capacity installed since then. part of the problem stems from heavy investment in cheaper, gas-fired plants in the mid-1990s by the dominant three generators, encouraged by a new pipeline from argentina. this created a surplus of generating capacity, which contributed to a 40 per cent decline in node prices between 1996 and 1999. at the same time, an international credit squeeze began depriving the chilean operators of funds for fresh investment, leading eventually to their sale to the large foreign groups. these companies now say that even after a recovery of prices in the last year, investment in new capacity remains unprofitable. one solution is the interconnection of the main chilean and argentine grids, but this will take four to five years. another is the connection of chile's over-supplied northern grid, fuelled by two gas pipelines from argentina, to the more populous southern grid. but this would not be feasible, said andres gluski. copyright: the financial times limited enron urges more electric power reform 05/16/2001 the yomiuri shimbun / daily yomiuri copyright (c) 2001 the yomiuri shimbun; source: world reporter (tm) - asia intelligence wire enron japan corp., a japanese subsidiary of united states energy giant enron corp., published a reform proposal for the japanese electricity market tuesday. the proposal urged the government to implement the suggested reforms over a two-year period beginning at the start of 2002, following deregulation of the japanese retail electric power market, which began in march this year. japan has allowed nonutility companies to supply power to industrial and commercial users since march. enron is seeking to enter the japanese energy market on a large-scale basis following the deregulation efforts. in the reform proposal, enron japan argued that the present liberalization of the electricity market was insufficient by presenting original data showing that japanese electricity charges were 46 percent higher than average when compared with those of other member countries in the organization of economic cooperation and development. enron's reform proposal includes 10 measures to promote competitiveness in the japanese market, such as a separation of conventional power companies' supply operations from the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. the proposal also contends that conventional power companies are monopolies that should be prohibited from constructing new electricity-generating facilities within the areas they currently supply. it also urges the privatizing of operations for the development of power sources. these measure are meant to make it easier for those newly entering the business to gain a competitive foothold. in march enron applied for approval from aomori prefecture to build a large thermal power plant in rokkashomura. copyright 2001 the daily yomiuri copyright , 2000 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. report on business: canadian enron lawsuit deal to broaden indexes david parkinson 05/16/2001 the globe and mail metro b10 ""all material copyright (c) bell globemedia publishing inc. and its licensors. all rights reserved."" calgary -- enron canada corp. has dropped its $101-million lawsuit against on-line natural gas trader ngx canada inc. and energy newsletter publisher canadian enerdata ltd., after reaching an agreement to have enron's on-line trading data included in key alberta gas pricing indexes published by ngx and enerdata. the deal, announced yesterday, will significantly broaden ngx's indexes by adding trades from north america's biggest on-line trading system, enrononline, to the calculations. it also opens the door for the development of a ""superindex,"" a single price index using combined trading data from key on-line trading systems. ""this can be seen as the first step toward that,"" said peter krenkel, president of calgary-based ngx, adding that other on-line trading services have already inquired about having their data included in ngx's indexes. enron filed its suit in november, alleging that it suffered ""irreparable harm"" when enerdata sold the rights to its natural gas price indexes to ngx, which operates the on-line natural gas exchange. ngx changed the method of calculating the indexes, basing them solely on trades over the natural gas exchange rather than enerdata's old survey of a wide variety of market participants. enron, a unit of enron corp. of houston, had argued that the new calculation method was less neutral and reliable than the old method. the indexes are used by many natural gas market participants as the basis for prices in gas hedging contracts. rob milnthorp, president and chief executive officer of enron canada, said the agreement to include enrononline's data in the ngx indexes ""will provide industry participants with a more comprehensive source of data and a better opportunity to manage risk around these price indexes."" copyright , 2000 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. saudi gas proj mous expected to be signed jun 6 - sources 05/16/2001 dow jones energy service (copyright (c) 2001, dow jones & company, inc.) dubai -(dow jones)- memoranda of understanding between international oil companies and saudi arabia on three gas ventures on offer in the kingdom are expected to be signed june 6, industry sources told dow jones newswires wednesday. saudi arabia's supreme petroleum council met tuesday and endorsed a final selection of international oil companies for each of the three projects, which have been estimated at a combined investment value of $25 billion, the sources said. the companies concerned are expected to be notified any time on whether they have been selected and given about 10 days to respond. the 11 companies being considered are royal dutch/shell group (rd), bp plc (bp), exxon mobil corp.

""it is almost a foregone conclusion that dpc will be asked to issue its termination notice,"" the paper said in an unsourced report. it said that foreign institutions which lent 30 percent of the $2 billion in debt back such a move. but indian lenders, whose loans are not backed by a federal government guarantee, are likely to vote against the proposal, the newspaper said. the industrial development bank of india , state bank of india , industrial finance corporation of india , canara bank and icici are the major indian lenders. enron and india have been sparring for six months over payment defaults by the maharashtra state electricity board (mseb) for power purchased from dpc. dpc, owned 65 percent by houston-based enron, is building the world's largest natural gas-fired power plant on india's western coast. the 740 mw first phase of the facility began operating in 1999. the plant's generation capacity will more than triple to 2,184 mw when phase two is completed next month. mseb had agreed in 1995 to buy all the power produced by the plant but has now reneged on that commitment, sparking concern over the fate of the project. last month the dpc board authorised its management to terminate the contract to sell power and the lenders' decision on wednesday could add weight to that decision.

""we are lucky that we did not get trapped in a similar project with the cogentrix. it is difficult to imagine what could have been the position of the kpc, if we had gone ahead with the agreement with the cogentrix,"" he said. mr. krishna said that it was for the reason of cost effectiveness that the proposed alamatti dam power project was handed over to the kpc when the offer made by tapco for its implementation was found to be ""extremely costly."" he said that after the tapco offered to complete the 290 mw project at a cost of rs.1400 crores, the kpc was asked to prepare the plan which it did with an estimated cost of rs.700 crores. immediately after that, the kpc was given the green signal to prepare the pre-survey of the project. ""if the project (alamatti dam power project) was handed over to tapco, it could have been profitable"" (which he said needed no elaboration), ""but it is the protection of the interest of common people which is of paramount interest to us. tapco may approach the court for the breach of agreement but we will fight it out there (court) also,"" he said. copyright , 2000 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. india: dabhol power project 05/16/2001 business line (the hindu) copyright (c) 2001 kasturi & sons ltd (ksl); source: world reporter (tm) - asia intelligence wire this refers to the article 'dpc-mseb slugfest: needed, a conciliatory approach' (business line, may 11). the author has tried to defend the dabhol project. unfortunately his claims hold no water for the following reasons: dpc is not the only ipp among the fast-track projects. the 208 mw jagrapadu in andhra pradesh (gvk power) was the first and is doubling capacity. spectrum (208 mw) was the second. enron is the third. st-cms in tamil nadu is almost complete. the other fast-track projects - cogentrix, hinduja power and bhadravati power (l. n. mittal) - are languishing. however, in terms of project cost, fixed-charge payments and the total tariff, dpc stands tall. several ipps have come up successfully without counter-guarantees: gmr, ppn, balaji and south india viscose in tamil nadu; and paguthan and gipco in gujarat. some are under development and their problems are not fdi, equity or debt, but the non-availability of the escrow - a result of bad management by the states. similarly, a number of lng projects is in the pipeline. if permitted, they could go on-stream in good time. let us remember that enron lng has a sovereign guarantee and a very high return on equity and is protected by a power purchase agreement (ppa) that will use only half its capacity. however, enron will recover its entire cost in that 50 per cent utilisation. enron's lng terminal will perhaps make the highest profits in the world. lng projects are feasible all along the coast and the enron project could even be sold to an outsider. the cancellation of the enron ppa will result in a huge liabilities to be paid by the people of maharashtra as a result of the follies of their political leaders. the project can be sold to international buyers at a reasonable price and the loss, if any, absorbed by the people of maharashtra who might be ready to pay an enron cess over the next 20 years. now let us come to the number-crunching. at rs 87.50 a month fixed cost, the net present value of the fixed cost of dpc- i over 15 years works out to (at 15 per cent per annum) rs 6,252 crore. for 740 mw, this works out to rs 8.45 crore per mw. at rs 292 crore, the net present value for the 2,150 mw dpc i and ii is (at 15 per cent pa for 15 years) rs 20,863 crore - rs 9.70 crore per mw. when dpc i was 740 mw, the npv per mw was rs 8.45 crore. to achieve scales of economy when the project was expanded to 2,150 mw with an lng project, the npv rose to rs 9.70 crore. is there any power project in the country, or the world, at this cost? be it naphtha or lng, the mseb is paying for the actual cost of the fuel. here too, enron is making a huge profit - burning naphtha at 1,700 kcal per unit and claiming reimbursement at 2,000 kcal per unit. when the fuel cost is reimbursed at actuals the expansion of dpc should have reduced the fixed cost. on the other hand, it has increased it to over 13 per cent. perhaps, the dpc project should be referred to the guinness book - for the highest cost per mw of power. certainly, nobody would dare beat its record. s. padmanabhan copyright , 2000 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. three members of godbole committee quit our bureau 05/16/2001 the economic times copyright (c) 2001 the economic times; source: world reporter (tm) mumbai even as efforts to renegotiate the enron power deal get underway, three members of the nine-member madhav godbole committee have decided to quit. former union energy secretary and andhra pradesh electricity board member e a s sarma, tata energy research institute director rajendra pachauri, and indira gandhi institute of developmental research professor emeritus kirit parikh have -- in separate communications -- informed the government that they do not have the time to attend the committee's meetings. the trio was absent from the committee's first meeting with dpc officials held last week. the godbole committee was set up by the maharashtra government to renegotiate the deal with enron. pachauri recently had said the state government had not consulted him before he was named on the renegotiations panel. the maharashtra government set up the nine-member committee headed by former bureaucrat madhav godbole on april 30 to renegotiate the controversial power purchase agreement with the enron-promoted dabhol power company. the committee has submitted an interim report and a final one is expected by may 31. the members now on the committee -- apart from madhav godbole -- are hdfc chairman deepak parekh, state's energy secretary v m lal, fertiliser secretary and a representative of the centre anil gokak, state finance secretary s k shrivastava and maharashtra state electricity board chairman vinay bansal. the government said it had chosen godbole to head the renegotiation team since he had dealt with every detail of the 2,184-mw dabhol power project. godbole was head of the maharashtra state energy review committee which recently submitted a report on the enron project to the state government in which he had strongly criticised the way the deal was conducted and had recommended the renegotiation of the power purchase agreement with mseb. the state government employee said: ""there is no point in reading too many things in the development. these three members really don't have time. the committee work will not hamper due to their decision to dissociate."" copyright , 2000 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. panel to brief gokak on godbole plans on wed our bureau 05/16/2001 the economic times copyright (c) 2001 the economic times; source: world reporter (tm) new delhi the committee of joint secretaries, which is working in close co-ordination with the enron negotiation committee, will be holding a meeting on wednesday to brief the central representative a v gokak on the centres views on the godbole committe recommendations. the group of joint secretaries from concerned ministries like power, petroleum, finance etc was formed to coordinate and form a consensus on the centres view vis-a-vis the recommendations of the godbole committee and the renegotiations that have now been initiated between dabhol power corporation and mseb. gokak was appointed as the centres representative on the renegotiation committee. since the recommendations of the godbole committee have been taken as some of the basic requirements and changes that could bring down tariffs, the centres stand on this issue will be viewed significantly. among the main things to be discussed would be to explore the possibility of delinking the lng facility from the power plant. copyright , 2000 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. settle enron issue amiably: munde the times of india news service 05/16/2001 the times of india copyright (c) 2001 the times of india; source: world reporter (tm) pune: former deputy chief minister gopinath munde has said that the us power major enron's exit from the dabhol power project could have a negative impact on investment prospects of the state. speaking to reporters here on monday, mr munde said it was imperative to have an amicable solution on the current impasse on the cost of power supplied by the dabhol power company. ""a confrontation on the power purchase agreement at such an advanced stage may send wrong signals to investors,"" he added. asked about the growing financial burden on the state exchequer due to hefty enron bills, mr munde evaded a concrete reply on the pretext that his party was not in power in the state at present. the senior bjp leader minced no words in saying that his party would strongly oppose any move by the state government to delink the 38 fringe villages from the pune municipal corporation limits. all the merged villages should stay within the corporation, he emphasised. speaking on the drubbing his party received in the just concluded assembly elections, mr munde said the party leadership had never expected miracles in tamil nadu, west bengal, kerala and pondicherry. ""the bjp did have high hopes in assam, but unfortunately the popular verdict was not in its favour. the party would analyse the reasons behind the debacle,"" he added. copyright , 2000 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. sharavathi power units inaugurated the times of india news service 05/16/2001 the times of india copyright (c) 2001 the times of india; source: world reporter (tm) karwar: chief minister s.m. krishna appealed to the courts of law on tuesday to ``speedily dispose of development-related litigation'' as such delays led to huge cost escalation of infrastructure projects. speaking after switching on the 60 mw units 1 and 2 of the sharavathi tailrace hydel power project at jyothinagar, gerusoppa (near honnavar), krishna said that this particular project itself had been delayed by five years because of the case filed against it in the supreme court by environmentalists. ``the courts heard arguments in the cogentrix case also about an year ago, but there has been no judgement. such delays lead to cost escalations,'' he contended. krishna said plans to add about 200 mw of power every year were on the anvil. ``gerusoppa units 3 and 4 will produce 60 mw by march 2002 along with the 210 mw raichur thermal power station (rtps) unit 7. almatti project 70 mw unit 1 and 220 mw unit 2 will be commissioned by december 2003. the 500 mw vijayanagara thermal power project will be operational by 2005, while the bidadi project will produce 700 mw by 2006,'' he outlined. in the private sector, krishna said the tannir bhavi barge-mounted plant would produce 220 mw, while jindal tractible would supply 100 mw and tata electric 80 mw. ``all these projects will involve an investment of over rs 10,000 crdore and even after this the state will need more power,'' he maintained. stressing on the need for low cost power, krishna said the cogentrix agreement fell through only because of the ``exhorbitant'' purchase price quoted by the american company. ``maharashtra is in the python grip of enron. we have avoided this even in the case of the almatti project, for which the company, tapco had given a cost estimate of rs 1,400 crore while the karnataka power corporation quoted only rs 700 crore,'' he added. legislative assembly and council opposition leaders jagadish shettar and k.h. sreenivas praised the kpc on its pro-active role in providing power to the state. karwar mp margaret alva and industries minister r.v. deshpande stressed on the need for improving the living conditions of the project displaced people. meanwhile, magsasay awardee k.v. subbanna of heggodu rued that the agitation against the project by environmentalists led by shivaram karanth and the pejawar math pontiff had not borne fruit. ``one mw of gerusoppa power has eaten away a minimum of 10 hectares of fertile, evergreen forest of the sharavathi valley which was once full of medicinal plants and rich bio-diversity. the kpc should at least take up an afforestation programme to ensure that sufficient rains fall to fill up the dam and produce power,'' he added. copyright , 2000 dow jones & company, inc. all rights reserved. dunham, lay, raymond among few to meet with cheney on energy 2001-05-16 00:01 (new york) washington, may 16 (bloomberg) -- archie dunham, chief executive of conoco inc., told vice president dick cheney that it was time to stop using unilateral sanctions as a diplomatic weapon against fuel-rich countries like libya. enron corp. chairman kenneth lay said he used his time with the vice president to talk about how to open power markets. and exxon mobil corp. ceo lee raymond made the case to cheney for reducing federal regulations. the three chief executives, all big contributors to president george w. bush, were able to make their case to a white house energy task force at the highest level: cheney is in charge of it. and when the task force releases its report tomorrow, many of their recommendations will be in it. no such access to cheney was available for many others. leaders of environmental groups, including the sierra club and the natural resources defense council, didn't make it onto cheney's calendar. neither did california governor gray davis, a democrat, who was told to submit a one-page memo. ``they bumped us to staff level,'' said alys campaigne, nrdc's legislative director. ``that there was no outreach to the ceos of environmental groups is striking.'' the task force is recommending a broad basket of ideas to encourage domestic fuel production, including regulatory changes that will make it easier to build more refineries, pipelines and transmission lines; plans to promote more oil and gas exploration; and tax credits to promote renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. `all sides' heard juleanna glover weiss, cheney's press secretary, says the idea that the energy task force had a two-tiered system for getting input is ``nonsense.'' she said cheney had only about a half dozen private meetings. ``the vice president has listened carefully to all sides of the debate,'' she said. the administration has spurned congressional and administrative inquires into whom top officials such as cheney, energy secretary spencer abraham and economic adviser lawrence lindsey met with. to some, the meetings are simply further evidence of the energy industry ties that both bush and cheney brought to the job, and the support they have received from that industry during the campaign -- roughly $2.9 million in contributions, according to the center for responsive politics, which tracks campaign finance. ``bush came in with goals and assumptions about energy that played right into the business community,'' said stu rothenberg, editor of the non-partisan rothenberg political report. supply-side arguments those who were willing to talk about their meetings with cheney described businesslike, formal sessions. lay said that he discussed ``the whole issue of making wholesale markets work better,'' a mantra for enron, the country's top wholesale power marketer. cheney made no commitments, lay said, but he was sympathetic. ``he fully understood,'' lay said. lay raised more than $100,000 for bush during the campaign. enron contributed nearly $2.4 million to candidates, with 72 percent going to republicans. the company was bush's tenth-largest contributor, at $113,800. conoco's dunham, who also raised more than $100,000 for bush, declined to discuss his march 21 talk with cheney except to say he expects the vice president will remain opposed to unilateral sanctions. the issue is a big one for conoco and other oil and gas companies unable to tap large holdings abroad because of u.s. sanctions in places like libya and iran. exxon, vice president jim rouse said that he and other officials met for 30 minutes with cheney feb. 8 and 45 minutes with the task force staff a week later. ``we don't want to wear out our welcome,'' he said. ``we had a story to tell, we told it, that was it.'' exxon contributed nearly $1.4 million in campaign contributions, with about 89 percent going to republicans. complaints from those left out for those denied access to the highest ranking members of the task force, the process confirmed fears of being shut out. ``the energy industry is in the white house,'' said anna aurilio, legislative director at the u.s. public interest research group. steve maviglio, a spokesman for davis, said california's democratic governor hasn't been allowed any more input than the other 49 governors. though the administration has contacted california republicans, maviglio said ``there hasn't been a very strong link engaging us in terms of the problems.'' a coalition of environmental leaders from 32 organizations known as the green group requested a meeting with cheney to no avail, though they did meet april 18 with environmental protection agency administrator christine whitman. later, the nrdc, a member of the group, filed formal requests to learn whom task force members saw. it was denied and the group is now appealing. democratic representatives henry waxman of california and john dingell of michigan, both members of the house energy and commerce committee, requested similar information. they received a reply may 4 that laura sheehan, the committee's democratic spokeswoman, described as ``inadequate.'' ``we just want to find out who's influencing them,'' said nrdc lawyer sharon buccino, ``because it isn't us, the environmental community.''"
