Hi Sara, I wanted to let you know that I made calls re: these files we 
previosly discussed:

Cross Timbers & Ocean Energy- Jay will call me next week when Fred gets back 
from out of town.

Quebicor - left messages for Ken.

Russell Metals - Carol will get back to me.

Camden -- figuring it out with Aparna.

""Gerald Sypro"" and could not find such a person in people finder -- but will 
figure this out.

Rosemary,
Dana Davis is sending the original wires back to you to enter into the A/P 
system for the month of January.  The wires have been sent out to Southwest 
Bank of Texas so you will only be entering this information into the A/P 
system but NO WIRES SHOULD BE SENT.

Please code (Debit) these 3 wires to 30016000, Profit Center 12854 (as marked 
on the wire request).  

Should you have any questions or problems, please call me at 853-5961.

Rosemary,

This needs to be entered in December 2000 in A/P.    Is it too late?  I sent 
the addresses on 1/2 and I heard A/P was still open for December on that 
date.  Yes, it will mess us up if you enter this is January.  What are the 
options?

Here are the addresses you needed for three wires processed in December that 
you faxed to Dana last week.  These are December payables, so they need to

Subject:	NETCO

The New Year has arrived and we really to finalize a lot of the work with regards to moving into NETCO.  Obviously we still do not have a deal but the deadline is approaching and preparations need to be finalized.

The main areas to focus on over the next week are:-

(i) 	Re-start/Integration Plans (due on Jan 7)				To be forwarded to Louise	
	These plans need to be detailed and show clear detailed timelines and detailed responsibilities for getting us up and running as soon as possible.  
	The current restart date is January 21, 2001 but may be pushed forward to January 14, 2002.	
(ii)	Budget (due Jan 3, 2002)						To be forwarded to Faith Killen 
	First year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized)
(iii)	Seating Plans								Tammy Shepperd to co-ordinate
	We need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the Enron South building.
	I have asked Tammy Shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around January 11,2002.
(iv)	Due Diligence
	We continue the process with two new companies this week (Wednesday and Thursday). Andy Zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on Wednesday, please help him with his requirements.

I would ask that both John and I are notified of any changes to the Netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis.  Please forward all alterations to Jeanie Slone who has responsibility for the master list.

Communication - I believe that the New Year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on Netco and what our policies are.  I am asking David Oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this.  I know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible.

(ii) budget (due jan 3, 2002) to be forwarded to faith killen first year budget to include all start up costs (some of which can be amortized) (iii) seating plans tammy shepperd to co-ordinate we need to start the planning process for seating as we will be living on floors 5 & 6 of the enron south building. i have asked tammy shepperd to commence the seating plan and we would look to start the moves as soon as possible but with a large number occuring around january 11,2002. (iv) due diligence we continue the process with two new companies this week (wednesday and thursday). andy zipper is taking the lead for the company arriving on wednesday, please help him with his requirements. i would ask that both john and i are notified of any changes to the netco personnel list on a timely fashion and that the list is maintained on a continual basis. please forward all alterations to jeanie slone who has responsibility for the master list. communication - i believe that the new year combined with a internal communication issues may be a good time to review what we want to say on netco and what our policies are. i am asking david oxley to co-ordinate with all of you on this. i know a lot of you believe that we need to only communicate once we have retention programme in place for the estate which may be a good idea but we we need to make sure that we lose as few people as possible. if you are unavailable this week, please ensure you delegate this work out. happy new year louise",5,"Org Structure, Crisis Management & Recruiting",Project Finance & Contract Correspondence

Sorry to miss your birthday. Did you have one in my honor?  You know I really 
did have one for you on vacation.

Points well taken - some we have already addressed, others probably need to 
be tied up better.

See you soon.

By the way, it hailed in DC today. Looked good from the bar at the Willard.

Joe, you should come clean on this one - you know what the understanding was ...... At  least for the North American piece maybe not EE&CC.

John, take a look at the DASH - I think I wrote several comments.

We have the AIG Highstar Fund in ENA.  As I understand it ENA committed to $12.5M on this with the other 50% coming from EE&CC.  I understand from Dave that you are taking the P&L swings on this fund.  As they are about to pull further on this money (<1m to date), I wondered how you wanted it treating.

Let's discuss

Greetings:

As many of you know the Governor held a press conference tonight- below is
the Summery.  Jan had a live Satellite feed-broadcast state wide-outside the
governors office at the end of the press conference in which NBC, ABC, CBS,
CNN, Fox, and several of their local, LA, Bay Area affiliates as well as
most of the Capitol Press Core including the Wall Street Journal, Sacramento
BEE. LA Times, Bloomberg, SF Chronicle, SJ Mercury News, AP and others.  WE
will keep you posted of others.  Just a reminder we will also be holding a
press availability tomorrow at 11:30 a.m. in which we will be discussing
further IEP's reaction to the Governors Press Conference and other events in
the Legislature this week.

As always we will keep you posted...

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
04/05/2001


GOVERNOR GRAY DAVIS DELIVERS
ADDRESS TO CALIFORNIANS ON
ENERGY

SACRAMENTO

Governor Gray Davis today delivered
an important live address on energy from his office in
Sacramento. The following are his
remarks as prepared for delivery:

""Good evening. I'm speaking to you
tonight from Sacramento on the most difficult issue facing
California: our energy crisis.

""Simply stated, we have two problems:
supply is too low and costs are too high. Both result from the
flawed deregulation scheme created in
1996. But no matter how we got into this mess, you hired me to
solve problems. And that's what I'm
doing.

""The only long-term solution is to
build more power plants. We must also cut back on consumption and
stabilize the utilities. But prices
won't fall and supply won't be truly reliable until we generate more
power than we consume.

""Yet in the 12 years before I took
office, not a single major power plant was built in California. Not one.
Since I became Governor, we've
licensed 12 major power plants. Ten more are in the pipeline. And
we're doing this without weakening
our commitment to clean air and clean water.

""Deregulation required the utilities
to sell off many of their power plants to independent generating
companies. The generators are free to
charge whatever they want because they're governed only by
federal regulators who refuse to
control wholesale energy prices.

""This past winter, the prices charged
by the generators shot through the roof, driving the utilities to the
brink of bankruptcy.

""In January, with the feds still
refusing to do their job, California stepped in to purchase the power the
utilities could no longer afford to
buy. We didn't take over to save the utilities. We took over to keep the
power on and the economy strong.
That's not all:

We also negotiated long-term
contracts for electricity at vastly lower prices.
I used my emergency powers to
seize control of low-cost power contracts the utilities were
about to forfeit to the
generators.
We began negotiations to buy the
utilities' transmission system.
We cut red tape and offered cash
incentives to speed up construction of power plants.
We're launching an $800 million
conservation program.
We're moving to establish a
public power authority to build more power. If the private sector fails
to build all the plants
California needs, we'll build them ourselves.
And because I share your concern
that the generators are ripping us off, we're using every legal
remedy to root out and punish
illegal conduct.

""We can't fix 12 years of inaction
overnight. But we're making real progress.

""Now, as you know, I have fought
tooth and nail against raising rates. It's become increasingly clear,
however, that with rising natural gas
prices, the feds' failure to control costs, and the state's lack of
supply, that some rate increases are
needed to keep our lights on and our economy strong.

""But I remain committed to protecting
average Californians from massive rate hikes. So I'm urging the
Public Utilities Commission to adopt
a plan that will protect average consumers, reward those who
conserve and motivate the biggest
users to cut back.

""Under my proposal, more than half of
you won't pay a penny more. For the rest, the average increase
will be 26 and a half percent. For
many of that group, rates will rise only about 10 percent. The heaviest
users will see their rates rise 34
and a half percent on average. That includes business paying their
share. This is in addition to the 9
percent surcharge we've all been paying since last winter.

""But all Californians can reduce
their bills through conservation.

""Here's the point: The more you use,
the more you pay. The more you conserve, the more you save.
Conservation is our best short-term
weapon against blackouts and price-gouging. By flexing your
power, you'll help secure our energy
future.

""Unlike the PUC, my plan includes
funds to restore the utilities to financial stability -- If they agree to
three main conditions:

""They must provide low-cost regulated
power to the state for 10 years. Agree to sell us their
transmission system. And dismiss
their lawsuits seeking to double your electricity rates.

""My proposal raises rates fairly,
assures us of long-term power, stabilizes the utilities and promotes
conservation.

""Our emphasis on conservation is
critical. In order to make it through the summer, we must cut
demand by at least 10 percent.

""Already we've launched programs to
cut back commercial lighting, and reduce consumption in office
buildings, schools and government
facilities.

""Friends, we have a power shortage
but we are far from powerless. We are 34 million strong and if
each of us does our part, we can
minimize disruptions and get through the summer. We are
Californians. We've withstood
earthquakes, floods, fires, and droughts.

""Yes, this mess is man-made, but with
your help and God's blessing, we'll get through this as well.

""Thank you and good night.""

Great idea -- hopefully we can make that happen.  These days with Mom and 
Dad, I have asked Patti to copy you, Cindy and them on my travel plans.  That 
way all of you will have numbers where I can be reached if something were to 
come up.  Hopefully, never needed!  

Have a great time in New York later this week.  I sent you a newspaper 
article in the mail today, that you may get before you leave.

Hello all:

I have some ""good"" news and I have some ""bad"" news.  The ""good"" news
is that we are growing!  The ""bad"" news is that we are running out of space.

Therefore,  just for the summer we need to use Jose's and Joe's offices
on the 19th floor for ""summer"" interns.

I will have to remove the extensions from those offices so they won't be
ringing all the time.  However, we can put them back after the summer is
over.

I hope this is not too inconvenient for you, but with Roman and Jason needing
spaces on the 19th floor, and another new hire coming on board, we are left
without any extra spaces.

Thanks!

Shirley

There will be two changes to the EnronOnline Website, effective for Monday 
morning:

1) There will be a new release for internal users only, which should fix the 
freeze-up of floating windows which some users have reported.
2) The old version of EnronOnline (the vesion without the news and weather 
content) will no longer be available.

The old version will be retired to make way for new functionality such as the 
Spreads product, which will allow customers to simultaneously transact in 
both of the underlying legs of a spread simultaneously.

Some customers are still transacting through the old version of the 
EnronOnline website. We are making every effort to contact all such customers 
directly, but it is possible they may call you, complaining that their 
website doesn't work. If this happens, please do the following:

1) Explain that the new version of the website is just as fast as the old 
version, but has additional functionality, like floating windows, news and 
weather.
2) Explain that there are solutions for any technical difficulties they might 
have in upgrading
3) Transfer them to Product Control for additional assistance.

Jeff,

I'll focus on the consolidation agreement today.

It seems to me that the time GE has to remit the payment to ENA should 
remain  3 days.  I don't see a reason to stretch it to  7 days, since it 
represents a double payment.  Your thoughts?

Looks like the tax issues are completed.

Kay

Subject: FW: Letter Agreement


AGREED!
I just corrected what I think is a typo (""has"" instead of ""as"", in a
Whereas), and changed the 3 to a 7 for days.
All we need is the Consolidation Agreement.
Per our last telecon, we should only be making statements dealing with the
fact that we have two contracts instead of one, not adding statements or
taking actions etc, which should be accomplished under one or the other
contract.

Jeff Smith

","cc: bcc: jeff, i'll focus on the consolidation agreement today. it seems to me that the time ge has to remit the payment to ena should remain 3 days. i don't see a reason to stretch it to 7 days, since it represents a double payment. your thoughts? looks like the tax issues are completed. kay on 06/09/2000 02:50:12 pm cc: agreed! i just corrected what i think is a typo (""has"" instead of ""as"", in a whereas), and changed the 3 to a 7 for days. all we need is the consolidation agreement. per our last telecon, we should only be making statements dealing with the fact that we have two contracts instead of one, not adding statements or taking actions etc, which should be accomplished under one or the other contract. regards, jeff smith -----original message----- [mail sent: friday, june 09, 2000 2:17 pm cc: <mail <mail <mail <<termination mourev2.doc>> jeff: here's a draft for your review: (see attached file: termination mourev2.doc) i suggest that the payment terms for the offshore contract require the intial payment to be made within 7 business days of execution. that way, we can sign this up next week. kay - termination mourev2.doc",6,Project Finance & Contract Correspondence,Project Finance & Contract Correspondence

The following are?summaries of today's appearance by  Sen. John Burton to the 
Sacramento Press Club and of his news conference this  afternoon announcing a 
lawsuit against FERC.
?
John Burton held what amounted mostly to a Q&A session at  a?lunch with the 
Sacramento Press Club today. He started by talking about  the Edison MOU, 
which he said will be assigned to the Senate Utility Committee  for review, 
the Judiciary Committee will look at the legal elements, and the  Natural 
Resources Committee will look at issues surrounding easements.?  (One 
columnist commented that Burton would ""love it to death,"" meaning it would  
get so much attention it will be hard for it to advance.)
?
The MOU, he said, includes language that eliminates oversight  by the PUC.? 
He said that will not be the case when it leaves the  Senate.
?
Burton is obviously troubled by?the MOU; he said ""some  people"" say it 
doesn't just make Edison creditworthy, it makes them whole.?  He said the 
following would have to take place for the MOU to be  acceptable:
?

Back debt must be verified;
All creditors must take a 30% ""haircut"";
The transmission lines would need to be purchased for an  amount close to 
what the governor has mentioned;
$400 million (or more) must come from Edison's parent to pay  back debt.

?
When asked whether $400 million was enough, he said ""no"" and  that he feels 
the parent should pay ""a ton.""? That led to a discussion of  the dedicated 
rate component, which he doesn't like.?He used  the example that if 
electricity costs $20 and the dedicated rate component is  $5, if prices drop 
to $10 people will unnecessarily pay higher rates.? A  larger infusion of 
cash from Edison's parent could eliminate the need for the  dedicated rate 
component. 
?
Burton called?the dedicated rate component a ""big  problem"" and said it could 
be the strongest argument for use in an initiative  campaign.
?
He said he planned to tell the governor this afternoon that  the state should 
set an acceptable purchase price for power and not pay anything  more (note:? 
this is a populist approach that is getting a lot of support  from radio talk 
shows and other media).? He later threw out the number  $200.? The state is 
going to have blackouts whether or not it pays top  dollar, he said, so this 
is one way he sees to fight back.? It's tough  medicine, but as he put it, 
""You've got to take castor oil and it tastes crappy,  but two days later 
you're over it and your stomach's OK.""
?
Burton also used a quote from his late brother, Phil, on how  he believe the 
situation should be handled:? ""The only way to deal with  exploiters is to 
terrorize the bastards.""
?
Asked how long the committee process would take re: the MOU,  Burton said the 
MOU sets August 15 as a deadline but that if there is ongoing  progress there 
are allowances that would let the process go as long as into  December.
?
?
LAWSUIT PRESS CONFERENCE
?
Shortly after the lunch, Burton held a press conference to  announce a 
lawsuit against FERC was filed today in the U.S. Court of Appeals for  the 
Ninth Circuit.? A copy of the brief and press release was faxed earlier  this 
afternoon to Jim Steffes and should be available in his office.? If  
additional copies are needed, please contact me or Scott Govenar.
?
The plaintiffs are Burton, individually and on behalf of the  Senate; Bob 
Hertzberg, individually and on behalf of the Assembly; and the City  of 
Oakland.? At the event were Burton, Hertzberg, Oakland Mayor Jerry  Brown, 
atty. Joe Cotchett of Cotchett, Pitre & Simon (in Burlingame); atty.  Clark 
Kelso, a constitutional scholar from McGeorge School of Law; Sen. Liz  
Figueroa; and Joan Breuner, vice mayor of Oakland.? 
?
The suit asks for FERC to respond within 7 days and a ruling  within 21 days.
?
Burton opened by explaining that they were suing FERC for not  fulfilling its 
statutory authority to maintain fair and justifiable rates.?  Hertzberg added 
that FERC had ignored the law and that they  were compelled to file suit for 
Californians' relief.
?
Joe Cotchett said the suit is ""very basic"" and is based on the  Federal Power 
Act, which he says limits power costs to ""fair and justifiable""  rates.??A 
primary?strategy in this suit is to present it as a  ""health and welfare"" and 
public safety suit; he noted that there are 3 million  disabled children and 
12,000 convalescent homes in CA who can be adversely  affected by blackouts.? 
He said it is ""not an economic lawsuit -- it's  about senior citizens, 
disabled kids and convalescent facilities.""? Today  also happened to be the 
legislative day for the California Association of Health  Facilities (the 
nursing home trade assn.), and several nursing home workers were  apparently 
asked to sit at the back of the room for effect.
?
Cotchett said FERC has been told for 3 years that there were  opportunities 
to exert market power.? He also claimed that a Redondo Beach  facility 
(obviously AES) was fined $8 million by FERC for taking its plant  off-line 
and substituting higher rates.? He said, however, that this order  had been 
sealed.
?
He cited an industry report that predicts 260 hours of  blackouts this 
summer, which could mean four hours a day.? That could be,  he said, 
""potentially the ruination of a lot of medicine in  refrigeration.""? Cotchett 
noted that only hospitals with more than 100 beds  are exempt from blackouts, 
which does not protect surgical centers or many  health facilities.
?
Jerry Brown added that ""prices are unjust and people are  suffering.""? 
Continued high prices could mean ""potential civic disruption,""  and that 
there will be ""more actions to mobilize"" Western mayors.
?
Liz Figueroa spoke briefly to reiterate the health aspects of  the lawsuit.
?
Burton had mentioned Clark Kelso, who regularly appears on TV  here as a 
legal expert and I believe was a colleague of Justice Anthony Kennedy,  in 
his Press Club appearance.? He said Kelso had appeared regularly in the  
media early on to say that the state had no standing to file the  
suit.?Burton's lawyer's sent him the brief, and Kelso thought enough of it  
to?join the legal team.
?
Kelso reiterated that FERC has been aware of potential market  power for 
three years, and that the commission has delayed  action?unreasonably.? It 
has failed to define ""fair and justifiable"";  that failure, he said, violates 
the Equal Protection and Due Process clauses of  the Constitution.
?
Kelso said this is not a partisan issue, and called upon  ""fellow 
Republicans"" to support the effort.
?
Joan Breuner (sp?), Oakland's vice mayor, said only that she  believed that 
if the energy situation were happening in Texas rather than  California, the 
president and FERC would have acted long ago.
?
During the Q&A session, Cotchett said the urgency filing  is necessary 
because ""5 generators supply 90%"" of the electricity in CA and all  five have 
rate renewals before FERC.? He also said one of the cases that is  relevant 
is Bush v. Gore, in which the Supreme Court found that failure to set  
standards (regarding elections, obviously, in that case) violates the Equal  
Protection clause.? He also said six states have expressed interest in the  
case and have requested briefs:? Oregon, Nevada, Arizona, Washington,  
Minnesota and one other he didn't name.? None of these states has yet  
committed to joining the suit.","the following are?summaries of today's appearance by sen. john burton to the sacramento press club and of his news conference this afternoon announcing a lawsuit against ferc. ? john burton held what amounted mostly to a q&a session at a?lunch with the sacramento press club today. he started by talking about the edison mou, which he said will be assigned to the senate utility committee for review, the judiciary committee will look at the legal elements, and the natural resources committee will look at issues surrounding easements.?

Yes, why don't you send the insurance information to us.  We have
received three quotes from the local man representing the company who is
handling my new 401K plan.  We could compareall of them and then talk to
you about it.  How does that sound?  How much information is there?
Would it be too much to fax?  If not, you could fax it to my work number
on Friday when I am there.  I don't have the fax number here at home, but
I can call there tomorrow (Thursday,) get it and get back to you.

We got a little more snow yesterday, but nothing compared to what Phyllis
and Tim both must have gotten!  I guess they are setting records for
North Carolina.  It surely is cold here, though.  I had to go downtown
today and the wind blowing up and down the streets between the buildings
was really bitter.  Three international flights bound for JFK had to land
here and stay all night.  Delta nearly filled a 500 room hotel!  There go
our ticket prices up again!

Love, Mother

I would like to thank all of you for putting quality time and effort into 
this important process.  There is nothing more important to ENA than 
attracting and retaining the most talanted and innovative people.

Effectively immediately, written and oral feedback for commercial managers 
and directors can be delivered. As per our discussion, the PRC process is 
primarily a feedback, performance management and staff planning tool.  It 
provides a data point for bonus purposes; however, it is not the only 
determinant.  In the interest of ensuring the most effective performance 
management tool, I would suggest that we implement the following:
 a)For employees ranked in the strong and above categories, the ultimate 
ranking should not be communicated and the message should focus on progress 
towards identified commercial goals and objectives and progress towards the 
further development of desirable leadership and commerical capabilities. 
Written and oral feedback should be delivered immediately;
 b) For employees ranked in the satisfactory, needs improvement and issues 
category, the ultimate ranking should be communicated to ensure approriate 
documentation of performance and to stimulate a plan to rectify or cure 
performance issues.  For the satisfactory category, the message should focus 
on increasing deal-flow, financial performance and productivity.  The bar is 
always being raised.  For the needs improvement category, the message should 
focus on turning around poor performance over the next six months.  For the 
issues category, the business unit manager should determine, in conjunction 
with your HR rep., the appropriate plan to find a better ""fit"" in the 
organization or counsel out.  Regardless, the ENA Office of the Chairman will 
require a written plan of action for all employees in the needs improvement 
and issues category from the business unit manager documenting the plan of 
action to rectify performance.

Vice President ranking can not be communicated until after the Enron VP PRC 
currently scheduled for July 31st.  I anticipate a similar process as above 
with our officer feedback process.  Associate and Analyst rankings can not be 
communicated until after the Enron A&A PRC currently scheduled for July 19th.

Other identified action items from the meetings include:
 a) the HR group will put together a ""profile and performance book"" for ENA's 
A&A's to ensure our representatives can augment performance information at 
the July 19th meeting;
 b) ENA will be aggressively attempting to retain highest performing A&A's to 
continue rotating within ENA;
 c) ENA will be holding an additional ""off-cycle"" A&A super-saturday for 
Houston and Portland in August to augment our capabilities in this area;
 and d) your HR representative is building a pipeline of outside employment 
candidates for your review each week.  Please review these resumes in a 
timely basis and let them know your interest or lack thereof.

Please communicate to your organization as appropriate.

I've been meaning to touch base with you about:

  In our form CSA, the Debt Rating Change is triggered ONLY off of S&P.  I 
thought this was a carry-over from ENE's previous split rating.  Does credit 
want to leave the trigger at ""below BBB- by S&P"" or also add in Moody's?

Hey Gillette,

The heat rate is going to depend on the type of fuel and the construction 
date of the unit.  Unfortunately, most of that info is proprietary.  

Chris Gaskill is the head of our fundamentals group and he might be able to 
supply you with some of the guidelines.

Hey Bass,

I have a question and I am hoping you can help me.  I am wanting to compile a 
list of all the different types of power plants and their respective heat 
rates to determine some sort of generation ratio.

i.e. Coal  4 mmbtu = 1 MW
 Simple Cycle 11 mmbtu = 1 MW

Please let me know if you can help me or point me to someone who can.  Just 
FYI...Bryan suggested that I call you so blame him as you curse me under your 
breath right now.

Thanks,
Lisa

We want to know how the 350MM gets shared among directors and officers if it is insufficient to pay everything.

Also, can we assume that this covers issues at foreign subsidiaries??

We do not provide copies of the policies.  

The Corporate indemnity is the first line of defense for the D's &O's.  If the indemnity responds, the company seeks reimbursement from the policy up to its limit.   There is no other D&O insurance above the $350,000,000, amount of insurance.

Please advise if there are further questions.

Gwynn,

Sally wasn't quite sure what you wanted.  She put together a little something 
- if you can use it fine, if not, that's fine too.

Opportunities for accounting professionals in traditional and in 
non-traditional roles, such as transaction structuring, risk analysis and 
commodity operations.

Laura Schwartz and I are working on pulling together the article that goes 
with the photo taken last week for the NABA national newsletter.  We get 
approximately 550 words to tell the Enron story in anticipation of our 
recruiting presence at the NABA national conference in July.  Are there any 
particular messages you would like us to get out there with regard to 
opportunities in EWS and EES for accountants?  Please let me know your 
thoughts before the end of next week (the sooner the better - the final due 
date for photo and story is April 13).

Republican Plan B
A source reports the following regarding the Republican Plan B proposal:
? Encourage direct access for consumers.  (The problem with this, however, is 
that these direct access deals would not have a dedicated rate component, and 
too many might undermine the cash flow and credit worthiness of the bonds.)
? The Republicans will ""suggest"" that generators take a 30% haircut.  ""We 
think this is doable.""
? The Republicans strongly oppose purchasing the transmission assets.
? Restore the invetor-owned utility model for generation.  They would 
establish a dedicated rate component for construction of native generation by 
the utilities.  They would grant ratepayers equity interest in these plants.
? Resolve the QFs' financial issues.

Assemblyman Cox commented afterward that the Republcans have been trying to 
work on a bilateral basis with the Democrats on these issues, but they feel 
""frozen out.""  Moreover, he senses the Democrats moving back toward having an 
option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets, which the Republicans oppose.

Democratic Plan B
A source reports the following regarding the Democratic Plan B:
? The Democrats are formulating a Plan B that incorporates the Governor's 
MOU, the Nation Plan B and other ideas that they have.  This plan reportedly 
has not yet been introduced into the legislature yet because it is still 
being finalized and the Democrats are not certain that it will work.  
Specifically, the option to purchase SoCal's transmission assets is 
reportedly still being debated.  Some Democrats reportedly believe that this 
may be unnecessary.
? The details of the plan are reportedly as follows:
- Set aside the $3.1 bilion undercollect in a separate account funded by a 
dedicated rate  component.
- The generators can either get a check instantly from the bonds for 70% of 
their  claim or they can try to get up to 100% of their claim adjudicated 
through a  dispute.
- This plan could be used as a template for going to the bankruptcy judge to 
strike a deal  for PG&E.
? Sources indicate that the Democrats are developing a post-petition plan in 
cast SoCal files for bankruptcy, including the following:
- The state would buy both utilities out of bankruptcy.  It then would sell 
of pieces of  the utilities to various private-sector buyers, but with a 
lifetime stipulation on  how they will be run.
- Some Democrats reportedly believe the state could do this with as little as 
$5 billion if  it assumed the utilities' debt and got a cram-down by the 
bankrutpcy judge to quell  the protests against such a plan that would very 
likely erupt.  Democrats reportedly  believe that the Judge Montali would 
support this idea.

Subject: Re: California PUC Decision Info/Update  

From the most recent information we have, the most likely outcome appears to 
be the following:

As we've discussed this week, the administration and the utilities continue 
to have a very difficult time reaching agreement on 1) how much of the 
undercollection the IOUs should absorb and how much consumers should absorb 
and 2) how big the rate increase should be to manage the IOUs cash 
flow/credit  problems (governor wants 10%, IOUs want at least 20%). 
It remains likely that the Commission will rule today on relaxing regulations 
to make it easier for the IOUs to enter into longer-term contracts w/out 
getting 2nd and 3rd guessed by the Commission.
It is likely that the Commission will signal strongly that it will not let 
the IOUs go bankrupt but will only go so far as to outline its plan for 
considering and implementing a ""rate stabilization"" plan in Q1 2001.

That said, the stakes are very high and things could change dramatically 
between now and 2 PM PST.  Just talked to two SVPs with PG&E and Edison and 
they said that they don't know what the Commission will do at 2.

Sally,
Hope all is well with you guys.   I am excited about our father-daughter
outing to ENRON FIELD later this month.  I understand that there is a person
at Enron who coordinates these events for us.  If you would not mind, would
you give me the person's name.
Eric is in the Boy Scouts and this sounds like an outing that would be
interesting for them also.
Thanks,
Andy","sally, hope all is well with you guys. i am excited about our father-daughter outing to enron field later this month. i understand that there is a person at enron who coordinates these events for us. if you would not mind, would you give me the person's name. eric is in the boy scouts and this sounds like an outing that would be interesting for them also. thanks, andy",2,Legal & HR Communications,Personal & Brief Work Messages

Just talked to the PUC.  Seems that EES is up-to-date on its registration and it's only EEMC that's not current.  Wade will get the 1K to Jeanne Bennett, who's filled out the requisite one-pager and will send check and paperwork to where it needs to get.

HOWEVER, the PUC person notified us that they previously received notice from the issuer of EEMC's security bond that EEMC's security has been canceled.  She said that we have until day-after-Xmas to get current on the bond.  She could not reveal who the issuer is and I don't have that info. Presumably someone in EES received notice that the issuer was canceling EEMC's security bond?  We need to get info on that.

We should therefore also double check that the the issuer of the EES security bond hasn't also canceled.

Let me know if you have any questions,  and let me know what we find out about the bond, or if there's anything I can do to assist.

Thanks,
Jeff

I'm continuing to work with IT in Houston in an attempt to restore the EOL 
Report to its former glory. They are making several changes to the report 
which seem to result exponentially in glitches. As of right now the 
application will not create any kind of file with any kind of data; hence the 
absence of any kind of report. I will keep you informed of our progress.

Our power MTM on the bilateral power contract with EPMI is roughly $20mm.  =
I spoke with SCE's CFO Jim Scilacci regarding a margin call we have made un=
der the power contract.  He is meeting this morning with his outside counse=
l and EIX CFO Ted Craver to discuss the terms with which they are willing t=
o post margin.  He is supposed to call me at 2:00PM to discuss further.

I am working with Carol St. Clair and Elizabeth Sager in legal.

This is all the information that I have when Ami first looked at all the CES 
information.  It does not mention a processing agreement, but that does not 
mean that there isn't one.





Daren - do you know anything about a processing agreement for the Devon gas

Dear David,

My name is David Ronkainen and I have been an Enron employee for about one 
year.  I joined 
Enron as a result of my interest in fuel cells as a business opportunity for 
me.  I met with Dave Ramm 
to discuss that opportunity and he asked me if I would be interested in 
working for Enron.  
I recently read a press release that ENA had entered into an alliance with 
Fuel Cell Energy, Inc.  I still 
have a strong interest in fuel cells and the belief that they will be the 
most commonly used power 
supply of the not so distant future.  I went to a seminar on distributed 
power in Washington D.C. last 
week to talk with the technologists and hear what the investment community  
thought about fuel cells 
and microturbines.  I learned a lot.

Right now I am working for Enron Corp. Environmental, Health and Safety.  My 
job is interesting, but I have 
a stronger interest in fuel cells and the power technology that will serve 
DP.  Do you have a job opportunity
for a technologist in your business that is involved with fuel cells and 
microturbines?  If there is an opportunity
I would like to talk with you about it.

I graduated from Michigan Technological University with a B.S. in Mechanical 
Engineering.  I have worked 
in manufacturing and the oil field service business.  I have worked at the 
corporate level in both businesses.
I know what it takes to efficiently manufacture a product and how a business 
should be run.  I also understand the 
opportunities and liabilities that environmental protection poses to new 
industries and technologies.  I  know
that I can help Enron in this area.

If you would like my resume please let me know.

Thank you for your consideration.

Sincerely,

David Ronkainen

Gregg,

It is my understanding that Enron and Peoples intend to discuss the most 
appropriate form of ISDA documentation for enovate to use. Peoples has 
forwarded a form for our information, and we would like to reciprocate.

Therefore, attached per your request are sample ISDA documents as a starting 
point for discussions.  Since these are forms, there will certainly be 
aspects which will need revision based on discussions between Peoples and 
Enron.  These documents should be treated as confidential.

Good Morning,
    Enclosed is a draft of a GISB for Utility Resource Solutions, LP.  They have done some small physical volumes secured by a pre-pay, but are interested in establishing a more developed relationship.  As such, they want to enter into a GISB with Enron.  This is their copy forwarded through Jay Reitmeyer.  Please review and advise what needs to be done, if anything, to get this executed.

      <p>Dear Mike,</p> 
<!-- This mail was sent to ""Mike Grigsby"" <Mike.Grigsby@enron.com>, who belongs to
list enl-members-html -->
<!-- CONTENT START -->
 <p>The Washington bureau will have a full plate when we return from
Thanksgiving break.  <b>Congress returns</b> with many lawmakers urging
action on energy legislation before the end of the year.  Washington
Bureau Chief Peter Cook says there's a <b>long list of legislation ahead
of energy</b> in the Democrat-controlled Senate, but <b>Republicans are
threatening to force a vote through a filibuster</b>.  In turn,
<b>Democrats are saying they'll filibuster</b> any energy bill
containing a provision to open <b>Alaska's Arctic National Wildlife
Refuge to drilling</b>.  The legislation battle continues next week.

<p>Peter also says the Washington bureau will continue to follow the
<b>FERC's major decisions</b> regarding how it assesses <b>market
power</b>.  The Commission announced a major change this week that will
impact many of the <b>large and small utilities across the country</b>.


<p>Also next week, we'll see what <b><I>Energy Daily</I> Publisher
Llewellyn King</b> has to say about <b>Pat Wood's performance</b> as
Chairman of the FERC.  And rumors are flying about <b>DOE Secretary
Spencer Abraham -</b> on Monday, King talks about the whispers he's
hearing in Washington.

<p>ENL's Gale Smith will have a report from the Houston bureau next week
on a <b>Louisiana company</b> that uses <b>rice hulls to create
power</b>.  <b>Agrilectric Incorporated</b> consumes some of this power,
but most of the electricity is sold to an area utility company.  We'll
have details next week.

<p>Also, Houston Correspondent Kim Benestante will bring us coverage
from the <b>Alaska Resources Conference</b> taking place next Thursday
and Friday.  We'll also bring you details on the <b>final report
regarding</b> the chosen route of the <b>Arctic natural gas
pipeline</b>.  The report is due to Alaska's Governor on November 30.

<p>We'll hear from Center for <b>Energy Efficiency and Renewable
Technologies Executive Director John White</b> next week.  ENL's Kym
McNicholas will speak with White about his organization's <b>opposition
to the state's long-term power contracts</b>.  Catch White from the West
Coast bureau next week.

<p>Closing Prices for Nov. 21, 2001:

<p>Crude: $18.96    	
<br>Unleaded: $0.5273	
<br>Heating Oil: $0.5342	
<br>Natural Gas: $2.813	

<p>Keep in mind things are subject to change at a moment's notice.
Occasionally guests have to cancel or change time slots.  We'll continue
to do our best to keep you updated on future interviews and events.
<b>Have a great Thanksgiving break!  We'll see you on Monday.</b>

<p><b>Be sure to watch our newscasts every business day - 9 a.m. to 5
p.m. ET, at the top of each hour.</b>

Enron urges more electric power reform

Enron Japan Corp., a Japanese subsidiary of United States energy giant Enron 
Corp., published a reform proposal for the Japanese electricity market 
Tuesday. 
The proposal urged the government to implement the suggested reforms over a 
two-year period beginning at the start of 2002, following deregulation of the 
Japanese retail electric power market, which began in March this year. 
?



Japan has allowed nonutility companies to supply power to industrial and 
commercial users since March. 
Enron is seeking to enter the Japanese energy market on a large-scale basis 
following the deregulation efforts. 
In the reform proposal, Enron Japan argued that the present liberalization of 
the electricity market was insufficient by presenting original data showing 
that Japanese electricity charges were 46 percent higher than average when 
compared with those of other member countries in the Organization of Economic 
Cooperation and Development. 
Enron's reform proposal includes 10 measures to promote competitiveness in 
the Japanese market, such as a separation of conventional power companies' 
supply operations from the generation, transmission and distribution of 
electricity. 
The proposal also contends that conventional power companies are monopolies 
that should be prohibited from constructing new electricity-generating 
facilities within the areas they currently supply. It also urges the 
privatizing of operations for the development of power sources. These measure 
are meant to make it easier for those newly entering the business to gain a 
competitive foothold. 
In March Enron applied for approval from Aomori Prefecture to build a large 
thermal power plant in Rokkashomura.

Enron Urges Reforms In Japan Electricity Market-Nikkei

TOKYO (Nikkei)--Asserting that cuts in electricity prices will help Japanese 
companies save as much as Y4 trillion, major U.S. energy firm Enron Corp. 
(ENE) on Tuesday urged Japanese power firms to revamp the electricity market 
by separating operations such as power generation, transmission and 
distribution, The Nihon Keizai Shimbun reported. 
Enron's 10-point proposal also calls for the construction of more power 
plants and full-scale deregulation of retail electricity, including sales to 
households. If such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to 
match the levels of other industrialized nations, Japan's industrial sector 
could trim its costs by Y4 trillion, Enron said. 
?



At a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by Enron, the company 
asserted that Japan's deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity 
auctions in 1996 and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant 
benefits to end-users. 
New suppliers entering the market only account for a combined 0.4% of the 
entire electricity sector, Enron said, criticizing the fact that power plant 
facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies. 
Regarding prices, an official representing operators of power generation 
facilities asserted that ""industrial-use electricity prices in Japan are 
stuck at a high level at around Y13 per kilowatt, compared with Y5 in the 
U.S., Y3 in Canada, Y9 in Germany and Y4-Y8 in Southeast Asia."" 
In fact, department store operator Takashimaya Co. (8233 or J.TKA), which 
last November switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity 
supply, was able to cut costs by Y450 million in the first year, said a 
company official. 
Enron hopes to generate competition by urging Japanese electric utilities to 
spin off different operations, analysts say. If the number of power 
generation facility operators increases, this will help bolster Japan's 
electricity trading market, an area in which Enron has a strong business 
interest. 
Splitting electricity operations into generation, transmission and 
distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new 
entrants. This will boost transparency in the fees that electric power 
companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power 
generation facilities, Enron says. 
Citing the power shortage in California, however, Japan's electricity sector 
has strongly opposed such spin-offs, stating that generation and distribution 
must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply.






Japan could cut 4 tril. yen a year in energy costs - Enron.

Japanese industries could save 4 trillion yen a year in energy costs if 
electricity charges were lowered to European and U.S. levels, a senior 
executive of U.S. energy firm Enron Corp. said Tuesday. 
At a business gathering in Tokyo, Steven Kean, an executive vice president of 
Enron, said electricity charges are still rising in Japan despite progress in 
cost reductions in Europe and the U.S. 
?


Japan needs to remove regulations on power transmission lines and let users 
choose suppliers freely, he said. 
Establishing an independent supervising body for the industry and mapping out 
transparent rules for information disclosure are also necessary, he said. 
Enron is seeking to enter the Japanese energy market on a full-fledged basis 
following Japan's deregulation in March of its retail electric power market. 
In March, it applied for approval from Aomori Prefecture, northern Japan, for 
a plan to build a large thermal power plant in the village of Rokkasho.






JAPAN: Enron says high power rates costing Japan.

TOKYO, May 15 (Reuters) - A senior executive of U.S. energy giant Enron Corp 
said on Tuesday that Japan could save an estimated four trillion yen ($32.45 
billion) in annual costs if electricity rates were cut to the average of 
members of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 
""If you were to pare Japanese industrial electric rates to the OECD 
average...savings to all...customers would be about four trillion yen per 
year,"" Enron Corp Vice President Steven Kean told a seminar in Tokyo. 
?



Speaking at a seminar on electric power deregulation, Kean said that 
indigenous factors such as steep land prices and a lack of natural energy 
resources were often blamed for Japan's high electricity rates. 
But he said these factors were not sufficient to explain Japan's high 
electricity rates. 
A report commissioned by Enron Japan Corp showed that in 1998 Japan's 
electricity rates for industrial users were 16.81 yen per kilowatt hour (kWh) 
compared to a second highest rate of 12.44 yen in Italy. 
Japan's business sector has expressed concern at the nation's high 
electricity rates, saying that it blunts their competitive edge on the 
international market. 
Kean also drew parallels between Japan, in the midst of deregulation, and 
California which has been suffering from a power shortage since deregulating 
its market in 1998. 
These included the length of time that authorities in Japan took to issue 
permits to allow the construction of new power plants, he said. 
""The regulatory structure in Japan is very strict...just like in California,"" 
Kean said. 
North America's biggest buyer and seller of electricity, Enron gained its 
first foothold in Japan in 1999 when it established affiliate E Power Corp. 
In April of last year, it set up subsidiary Enron Japan Corp. 
Kean urged Japan to step up measures to open up its power market, a process 
he said held many benefits. 
Japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. Since March last 
year, large-lot consumers have been free to chose their suppliers. The 
measure liberalised an estimated 30 percent of the power market and ended 
Japan's 10 power utilities regional monopoly. 
However, industry watchers note that there have been very few new entrants 
and that further deregulation measures must be taken for rates to fall. The 
Japanese government is due to review the process in 2003.






Japan Must Speed Up Pwr Sector Dereg To Lower Rates-Indus

TOKYO -(Dow Jones)- Japan should accelerate the ongoing electric power sector 
deregulation to fully liberalize the retail market, in order to bring down 
the country's high power rates while ensuring stable power supply, experts 
said at an industry seminar Tuesday. 
The pressure is mounting for Japan's 10 power utilities, which have long 
enjoyed regional monopolies until a year ago, to become cost- effective and 
performance-conscious after the government partially liberalized the retail 
power market in March 2000. 
?



However, the current scheme has so far failed to lure a large number of 
potential entrants because of the high transmission fees they must pay to 
conventional power companies. 
""What happened in overseas (power industries) suggest that the liberalization 
in Japan wouldn't only lower power rates but would also contribute to stable 
power supply significantly,"" said Tatsuo Hatta, professor of economics at the 
University of Tokyo. 
Compared with the U.S., Japanese electricity charges are typically twice as 
much for households and three times higher for industrial users. 
""There is a large discrepancy (in rates), and that is why we should hurriedly 
implement the liberalization,"" Hatta said. 
He said Japan's steep seasonal peak-load curve - one of the reasons the power 
companies cite as the cause of high power rates in Japan - can be altered 
once the prices are liberalized. ""If power rates are set higher during those 
peak hours following the liberalization, users would refrain from using 
electricity."" 
Steven Kean, executive vice president of the U.S. energy major, Enron Corp. 
(ENE), told the same seminar that Japan's power costs remain on the upward 
trend despite cost reductions in Europe and the U.S. 
He said Japan could achieve a cost-saving of Y4 trillion a year if its power 
prices fall to levels in Organization for Economic Cooperation and 
Development countries following the liberalization. 
Hatta and Kean were speaking at the seminar called ""Reassessing Power 
Deregulation,"" which was co-sponsored by the Houston-based Enron. 
      

  Hatta of the University of Tokyo said ""it's very wise"" that Japan has begun
the deregulation with the ""bilateral supply, or trade"" system under which
suppliers and users clinch deals directly.    

  Under the current reforms, the sector for high-volume, large-lot industrial
and commercial users - which represents only 30% of the Y15 trillion market -
is opened to free competition. The government is to review the partial
deregulation by 2003 for further deregulation.   

  Japan should then introduce spot electricity trading such as futures and
derivatives to alleviate risks of complicated price volatility for power
providers, Hatta said.    

  Hatta and other experts attending the seminar said further deregulation
should destroy the systems that have supported the country's high power rates
- regional monopolies and the fair rate return method, under which all costs
are levied on prices.    

  ""There is absolutely no need to set the same (power) prices"" nationwide,
Hatta said. Power companies should make the opaque transmission fees
transparent and set them accordingly with regional demand, he said.    

  Yoshinori Omuro, vice president of Takashimaya Co.'s (J.TKA or 8233)
management department, acknowledged the slow progress of the deregulation.    

  Takashimaya, a major department store operator, has shifted to Diamond Power
Corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp. (J.MIB or 8058) as its
power supplier at two of its 18 stores, with ""strong back-up"" from the
Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry.    

  ""Despite the deregulation, the situation isn't where we can negotiate with
power utilities to reduce (electricity costs). We have no choice but select

","----- forwarded by mika watanabe/ap/enron on 05/16/2001 10:34 am ----- mika watanabe 05/16/2001 10:29 am cc: jackie eva enron urges more electric power reform 05/16/2001 the yomiuri shimbun / daily yomiuri copyright (c) 2001 the yomiuri shimbun; source: world reporter (tm) - asia intelligence wire ? ? enron japan corp., a japanese subsidiary of united states energy giant enron corp., published a reform proposal for the japanese electricity market tuesday. the proposal urged the government to implement the suggested reforms over a two-year period beginning at the start of 2002, following deregulation of the japanese retail electric power market, which began in march this year. ? japan has allowed nonutility companies to supply power to industrial and commercial users since march. enron is seeking to enter the japanese energy market on a large-scale basis following the deregulation efforts. in the reform proposal, enron japan argued that the present liberalization of the electricity market was insufficient by presenting original data showing that japanese electricity charges were 46 percent higher than average when compared with those of other member countries in the organization of economic cooperation and development. enron's reform proposal includes 10 measures to promote competitiveness in the japanese market, such as a separation of conventional power companies' supply operations from the generation, transmission and distribution of electricity. the proposal also contends that conventional power companies are monopolies that should be prohibited from constructing new electricity-generating facilities within the areas they currently supply. it also urges the privatizing of operations for the development of power sources. these measure are meant to make it easier for those newly entering the business to gain a competitive foothold. in march enron applied for approval from aomori prefecture to build a large thermal power plant in rokkashomura. copyright 2001 the daily yomiuri enron urges reforms in japan electricity market-nikkei ? 05/15/2001 dow jones international news (copyright (c) 2001, dow jones & company, inc.) ? ? tokyo (nikkei)--asserting that cuts in electricity prices will help japanese companies save as much as y4 trillion, major u.s. energy firm enron corp. (ene) on tuesday urged japanese power firms to revamp the electricity market by separating operations such as power generation, transmission and distribution, the nihon keizai shimbun reported. enron's 10-point proposal also calls for the construction of more power plants and full-scale deregulation of retail electricity, including sales to households. if such measures are carried out and electricity prices fall to match the levels of other industrialized nations, japan's industrial sector could trim its costs by y4 trillion, enron said. ? at a seminar on power industry deregulation hosted by enron, the company asserted that japan's deregulation in such areas as wholesale electricity auctions in 1996 and bulk retail sales last year has not brought significant benefits to end-users. new suppliers entering the market only account for a combined 0.4% of the entire electricity sector, enron said, criticizing the fact that power plant facilities are mainly concentrated among electric power companies. regarding prices, an official representing operators of power generation facilities asserted that ""industrial-use electricity prices in japan are stuck at a high level at around y13 per kilowatt, compared with y5 in the u.s., y3 in canada, y9 in germany and y4-y8 in southeast asia."" in fact, department store operator takashimaya co. (8233 or j.tka), which last november switched to new market entrants for part of its electricity supply, was able to cut costs by y450 million in the first year, said a company official. enron hopes to generate competition by urging japanese electric utilities to spin off different operations, analysts say. if the number of power generation facility operators increases, this will help bolster japan's electricity trading market, an area in which enron has a strong business interest. splitting electricity operations into generation, transmission and distribution is expected to open the electric utility network to new entrants. this will boost transparency in the fees that electric power companies charge for transmitting power on behalf of the operators of power generation facilities, enron says. citing the power shortage in california, however, japan's electricity sector has strongly opposed such spin-offs, stating that generation and distribution must be part of a single continuum to ensure a stable supply. japan could cut 4 tril. yen a year in energy costs - enron. ? 05/15/2001 kyodo news copyright kyodo news international inc. 2001 ? japanese industries could save 4 trillion yen a year in energy costs if electricity charges were lowered to european and u.s. levels, a senior executive of u.s. energy firm enron corp. said tuesday. at a business gathering in tokyo, steven kean, an executive vice president of enron, said electricity charges are still rising in japan despite progress in cost reductions in europe and the u.s. ? japan needs to remove regulations on power transmission lines and let users choose suppliers freely, he said. establishing an independent supervising body for the industry and mapping out transparent rules for information disclosure are also necessary, he said. enron is seeking to enter the japanese energy market on a full-fledged basis following japan's deregulation in march of its retail electric power market. in march, it applied for approval from aomori prefecture, northern japan, for a plan to build a large thermal power plant in the village of rokkasho. japan: enron says high power rates costing japan. ? 05/15/2001 reuters english news service (c) reuters limited 2001. ? ? tokyo, may 15 (reuters) - a senior executive of u.s. energy giant enron corp said on tuesday that japan could save an estimated four trillion yen ($32.45 billion) in annual costs if electricity rates were cut to the average of members of the organisation for economic cooperation and development (oecd). ""if you were to pare japanese industrial electric rates to the oecd average...savings to all...customers would be about four trillion yen per year,"" enron corp vice president steven kean told a seminar in tokyo. ? speaking at a seminar on electric power deregulation, kean said that indigenous factors such as steep land prices and a lack of natural energy resources were often blamed for japan's high electricity rates. but he said these factors were not sufficient to explain japan's high electricity rates. a report commissioned by enron japan corp showed that in 1998 japan's electricity rates for industrial users were 16.81 yen per kilowatt hour (kwh) compared to a second highest rate of 12.44 yen in italy. japan's business sector has expressed concern at the nation's high electricity rates, saying that it blunts their competitive edge on the international market. kean also drew parallels between japan, in the midst of deregulation, and california which has been suffering from a power shortage since deregulating its market in 1998. these included the length of time that authorities in japan took to issue permits to allow the construction of new power plants, he said. ""the regulatory structure in japan is very strict...just like in california,"" kean said. north america's biggest buyer and seller of electricity, enron gained its first foothold in japan in 1999 when it established affiliate e power corp. in april of last year, it set up subsidiary enron japan corp. kean urged japan to step up measures to open up its power market, a process he said held many benefits. japan is in the process of deregulating its power market. since march last year, large-lot consumers have been free to chose their suppliers. the measure liberalised an estimated 30 percent of the power market and ended japan's 10 power utilities regional monopoly. however, industry watchers note that there have been very few new entrants and that further deregulation measures must be taken for rates to fall. the japanese government is due to review the process in 2003. japan must speed up pwr sector dereg to lower rates-indus ? 05/15/2001 dow jones energy service (copyright (c) 2001, dow jones & company, inc.) ? ? tokyo -(dow jones)- japan should accelerate the ongoing electric power sector deregulation to fully liberalize the retail market, in order to bring down the country's high power rates while ensuring stable power supply, experts said at an industry seminar tuesday. the pressure is mounting for japan's 10 power utilities, which have long enjoyed regional monopolies until a year ago, to become cost- effective and performance-conscious after the government partially liberalized the retail power market in march 2000. ? however, the current scheme has so far failed to lure a large number of potential entrants because of the high transmission fees they must pay to conventional power companies. ""what happened in overseas (power industries) suggest that the liberalization in japan wouldn't only lower power rates but would also contribute to stable power supply significantly,"" said tatsuo hatta, professor of economics at the university of tokyo. compared with the u.s., japanese electricity charges are typically twice as much for households and three times higher for industrial users. ""there is a large discrepancy (in rates), and that is why we should hurriedly implement the liberalization,"" hatta said. he said japan's steep seasonal peak-load curve - one of the reasons the power companies cite as the cause of high power rates in japan - can be altered once the prices are liberalized. ""if power rates are set higher during those peak hours following the liberalization, users would refrain from using electricity."" steven kean, executive vice president of the u.s. energy major, enron corp. (ene), told the same seminar that japan's power costs remain on the upward trend despite cost reductions in europe and the u.s. he said japan could achieve a cost-saving of y4 trillion a year if its power prices fall to levels in organization for economic cooperation and development countries following the liberalization. hatta and kean were speaking at the seminar called ""reassessing power deregulation,"" which was co-sponsored by the houston-based enron. hatta of the university of tokyo said ""it's very wise"" that japan has begun the deregulation with the ""bilateral supply, or trade"" system under which suppliers and users clinch deals directly. under the current reforms, the sector for high-volume, large-lot industrial and commercial users - which represents only 30% of the y15 trillion market - is opened to free competition. the government is to review the partial deregulation by 2003 for further deregulation. japan should then introduce spot electricity trading such as futures and derivatives to alleviate risks of complicated price volatility for power providers, hatta said. hatta and other experts attending the seminar said further deregulation should destroy the systems that have supported the country's high power rates - regional monopolies and the fair rate return method, under which all costs are levied on prices. ""there is absolutely no need to set the same (power) prices"" nationwide, hatta said. power companies should make the opaque transmission fees transparent and set them accordingly with regional demand, he said. yoshinori omuro, vice president of takashimaya co.'s (j.tka or 8233) management department, acknowledged the slow progress of the deregulation. takashimaya, a major department store operator, has shifted to diamond power corp., a wholly-owned subsidiary of mitsubishi corp. (j.mib or 8058) as its power supplier at two of its 18 stores, with ""strong back-up"" from the ministry of economy, trade and industry. ""despite the deregulation, the situation isn't where we can negotiate with power utilities to reduce (electricity costs). we have no choice but select independent power providers,"" omuro said. -by maki aoto, dow jones newswires; 813-5255-2929;",11,"IT Notices, M&A Analytics & Industry Bulletins","IT Notices, M&A Analytics & Industry Bulletins"

To Mr. Ken Lay,

I'm writing to urge you to donate the millions of dollars you made from selling Enron stock before the company declared bankruptcy to funds, such as Enron Employee Transition Fund and REACH, that benefit the company's employees, who lost their retirement savings, and provide relief to low-income consumers in California, who can't afford to pay their energy bills.  Enron and you made millions out of the pocketbooks of California consumers and from the efforts of your employees.

Indeed, while you netted well over a $100 million, many of Enron's employees were financially devastated when the company declared bankruptcy and their retirement plans were wiped out.  And Enron made an astronomical profit during the California energy crisis last year.  As a result, there are thousands of consumers who are unable to pay their basic energy bills and the largest utility in the state is bankrupt.

The New York Times reported that you sold $101 million worth of Enron stock while aggressively urging the company's employees to keep buying it.  Please donate this money to the funds set up to help repair the lives of those Americans hurt by Enron's underhanded dealings.

Sincerely,

Please find enclosed a draft CA for the McNeil bullet work for your
review.  I would like to highlight a couple of points;

- we had talked about a press release being issued by mid-December
during our initial meeting in Houston on Nov. 9.   The CA as currently
worded would require all parties concurrence on any press release.  In
meeting the spirit of the CA, TransCanada would like to state that it
would like to meet that deadline for issuing a press release and would
ask each of you to indicate whether you would support that or not.  We
will have some points available within a week outlining what we feel the
release would say but it would be similar to what we discussed
previously.

- on the issue of entities to be covered by the CA, we would ask that El
Paso consider a corporate entity rather than ANR.  Our reason is that
resources are likely to be seconded from groups other than ANR within El
Paso and we would like the CA to cover all relevant entities and
personnel directly than indirectly through ANR.

As a final note, the first draft of the Joint development agreement
should be ready late Wednesday.  Recognizing that Thursday is a holiday,
the draft should be on your email by Friday morning for your review. -
thanks - Paul

Commercial Risk Reinsurance is very well known and reputable, according to
the BoA insurance portfolio manager.
We do see ACA a lot through our muni derivatives business.  They will insure
lower rated credits (A- to BBB-, and some below that) who are seeking an A
rating but do not want to pay for a AAA rating.  Should be fine from our
standpoint.

Susan, I have read your brief. It looks great. Do you think we should
comment about the core having the ability under this settlement to match its
upstream commitments ,i.e. no stranding etc,  . I only raise this issue
because of the judge's desire to insure the core sector receive measurable
benefits from any proposed settlement. Call if you have any questions, Mark

Defensive Opportunities??  Duane Cahill from the Pittsburgh Tribune Review 
checks in with his  weekly look at defensive situations across the league 
that could create  opportunities for the offensive players across the line 
from them.
?
Once again this week, Zach Thomas finds himself on  the inactive list. 
Without him, the Miami D gave up 95 yards to Ahman Green last  Sunday.? James 
Stewart scored three times a couple of weeks back against  the Bucs tough D 
(without MLB Jamie Duncan), so there's no reason not to start  him, 
regardless of the matchup.

In the same game, keep an eye on Stephen  Boyd's status with the Lions.? He's 
missed most of the week's practices  with a bruised foot that was sore enough 
there was concern it was  fractured.? If he can't go, that opens things up 
for the 'Fins Lamar  Smith.

Keith Brooking joined Jessie Tuggle on the IR this week, meaning  that Mike 
Alstott will have huge holes up the middle of the Falcons' defense to  rumble 
through.? Look for big games from both him and Warrick  Dunn.

Bryce Paup and Orlando Thomas remain out of the Vikings lineup,  which bumps 
Brett Favre's stock up a few notches.? Shaun King had a field  day last week.

For the second straight week, Jerome Bettis is facing a  defensive line 
without key components.? Henry Ford is out, and Kenny Holmes  is nursing a 
very sore shoulder.? Holmes will have to tough it out since  backup Byron 
Frisch is inactive.? The bus should keep rollin'  on.

As reported by Mark Gaughan of the  Buffalo News, Rob Johnson may be  on the 
sidelines, but he's no longer silent about the Buffalo Bills'  brewing 
quarterback controversy. Johnson took exception to a column  in this week's 
Sports Illustrated that quoted two  unidentified Bills speaking about the 
team's quarterbacks. 

The story quoted one Bill as saying, ""Rob  seems distracted by things, like 
wanting everyone to like him."" It  quoted another as saying, ""He'd rather get 
pummeled by four guys  than throw the ball away"" in order to help his 
quarterback rating.  

Johnson, who did not make himself  available to local media this week, went 
on the Jim  Rome nationally syndicated radio show Friday and said he  thinks 
it was one player who made the comments. And he thinks that  one player was 
Doug Flutie. 

""I think everyone who reads the article  will pretty much know who it is,"" 
Johnson said. ""I think it's the  same one that's pictured in the article."" 

The only Bill pictured in the article is  Flutie. 

Johnson said he confronted the player  whom he suspected on Friday. 

""We talked about it today,"" Johnson said.  ""He said he talked about the 
quarterback rating stuff, but he never  mentioned my name. Basically, that 
was it."" 

Asked if he thought Flutie was a good  teammate, Johnson said: 

""I'm sure he's a good teammate for the  rest of the guys, and he's fine with 
them. Obviously, he's real  competitive. He's reaching the end of his career. 
He probably wants  to still play. I don't blame him for that. But if he was 
responsible  for these comments, I would not consider him a good teammate.""  

Johnson said he did not see the team  being divided over the QB question. 

""I don't see it that way,"" he said. ""I  don't know though. I mean, I haven't 
talked to all the players. But  I don't think many players in our locker room 
worry about  quarterback rating or even worry about what our quarterback 
ratings  are. It's absurd to think players worry about that or even  
quarterbacks worry about that when they are playing in a football  game."" 

However, he said he didn't like  unattributed comments from teammates. 

""For someone to go anonymously and say  those things is kind of, I don't 
know, cowardly,"" he said. ""It's not  typical of football players... If a lot 
of guys feel that way, they  should come to me and say it to my face,"" he 
said. ""I'm a man.  They're men, and I can take it. I'd rather hear about it 
from them  than hear about it on the radio when I'm driving home, from an FM  
channel when I'm trying to listen to Limp Biskit."" 

Regarding the desire to be liked by his  teammates, Johnson said: 

""I'm 27 years old. Most of guys on our  team are pretty young and we have a 
lot in common. We hang out. I  don't go out of my way to make friends or kiss 
anyone's butt.  Everywhere I've been on teams, I've had a good relationship 
with the  guys on the team and I have a lot in common with them."" 

Asked if he got the sense he was  competing against Joe Montana for the QB 
job,  Johnson replied, ""I wish it was Joe Montana, because at least he won  
some Super Bowls and won MVPs in the league. I wish that was the  case. I 
think that would be an easier situation."" 

Regarding his injured shoulder, Johnson  said it is not 100 percent. 

""It tightened up on me pretty good  today,"" he said. ""I haven't been able to 
get my arm pretty much all  the way over the top or raise it all the way 
above my head to throw  the ball. I've kind of been side-arming things just 
trying to get  through practice so I could be the backup. I don't know what 
they  are going to do. I want to back up, but that might not be in the  best 
interest in the team (this week)."" 

Head coach Wade Phillips  said Friday he would wait until pregame warm-ups 
Sunday to decide  whether Johnson would be number-two or number-three against 
New  England. 

Although Phillips wasn't willing to  address the escalating tension between 
Johnson and Flutie, Buffalo  general manager John Butler, speaking on the  
Empire Sports Network, said he doesn't fear the  team is in turmoil. 

""I was at practice today and it looked  like a football team preparing for 
the New England Patriots,"" he  said. ""I'll tell you, if you've been around 
sports, been in locker  rooms, if you get 53 men together, not everybody is 
going to like  everybody all the time. The key is to be respectful of one 
another  and when it comes time to play, you play hard and play together.  

""Everybody isn't going to be walking hand  in hand down the hallways, but 
we've got a team that's going to  stick together and play their hearts out 
and that's all that  matters. 

""These are grown men. Sometimes it's fun  to even blow it up a little bit 
more than it is, and so be it. It's  incumbent upon our team to stick 
together and they will,"" he said.  ""I've been through this 150 times."" 

Butler dismissed the SI quotes because  they had no attribution. 

""If you want to say something and can't  put your name to it, it bothers me,"" 
he said. ""You've got a problem  somewhere so I don't put any substance to 
it."" 

Stay tuned boys and girls... We haven't  heard the last of this one...

REDMOND INJURES FOOT;  PATS LIKELY TO RELY ON FAULK...

According to Frank Dell'Apa of the  Boston Globe, it looks like Kevin  Faulk 
will be asked to carry running game when the New  England Patriots take on 
the Buffalo Bills tomorrow. 

Faulk's opportunity comes at the expense  of rookie J.R. Redmond, who 
displaced Faulk in the  starting lineup with a 22-carry, 97-yard performance 
against the  Colts two weeks ago, but was downgraded to questionable on 
Friday's  injury report after hurting his foot in practice Thursday. 

According to head coach Bill  Belichick, Redmond ""stepped on something at 
practice and  wasn't able to do much (Friday)."" 

""I don't know if I'll be playing more,""  Faulk said. ""Whatever the game plan 
is, I'm ready every week.""  

Faulk will be facing a difficult test  this time. Buffalo has surrendered 585 
rushing yards, the  second-lowest total in the NFL. 

""All you have to do is check the stats,""  Faulk said. ""Teams don't average 
more than 3 yards a carry against  them."" 

The Patriots are averaging 3.4 yards per  rush and Faulk is averaging 3.7 
yards per rush. 

""It's always a challenge, but this time  it's even more of a challenge 
because we are going against one of  the best defenses in the league,"" Faulk 
said. ""We can't expect to  run over them, no. What we need is a balanced 
attack. If we can get  that going and move the football, we should be all 
right."" 

Faulk was on pace to gain more than 1,000  yards after four games but he has 
tailed off with a total of 171  yards in the last four games. 

But Faulk is the team's leading  all-purpose yardage player with 1,156 yards, 
an average of 7 yards  each time he has the ball. 

Team officials had hoped the Redmond's  ascension to the first team would 
allow Faulk to concentrate on what  most observers feel he is best suited 
for: third-down duty. 

As productive as he might have been the  first half of the season, concerns 
over Faulk's durability have been  an issue from day one and Belichick is 
convinced the former LSU  standout's ability to run the ball effectively is 
inversely  proportional to the number of time he carries it... 

Other items of interest... 

After working extensively at wide  receiver this week, tight end Eric 
Bjornson was  included on the team's list of early inactives yesterday. And 
his  chances of contributing to the offense in coming weeks don't sound  very 
good after team officials indicated that Rod Rutledge will  start at tight 
end for the remainder of the season... 

Wide receiver Terry  Glenn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice, but  
he's listed as probable and coaches expect him to start and play as  usual 
against the Bills tomorrow. 

Quarterback Drew Bledsoe  missed Thursday's practice in order to stay with 
his wife as she  gave birth to the couple's third child. The veteran signal 
caller  will start and play as usual tomorrow.

REDSKINS' JOHNSON HAS  SIGNIFICANT MCL TEAR...

Mark Maske of the Washington  Post reported this morning that Redskins 
quarterback  Brad Johnson is suffering from a significant tear  to the medial 
collateral ligament in his left knee that is  relatively close to being a 
complete tear. 

Maske went on to write, ""even when his  MCL heals sufficiently for him to 
resume playing, Johnson will face  the risk of suffering a more severe knee 
injury by playing on the  damaged joint. He will have to decide how much risk 
to take playing  for a team he might leave via free agency in the offseason, 
at a  time when his contract is about to expire and he has no guaranteed  
income beyond this season. 

""As he exited Redskins Park yesterday,  Johnson acknowledged the increased 
risks but said he plans to play  again this season and will make his 
decisions based solely upon his  physical readiness to play, not upon future 
financial  considerations. He said the timetable for his return is unclear, 
but  he refused to rule out the possibility of playing in the St. Louis  
game."" 

Team officials expect Johnson to miss  that November 20 meeting with the 
Rams. Of course, the former Viking  has already been ruled out for tomorrow's 
game against Arizona and  Jeff George will make his first appearance with  
Washington's first team offense this season. 

Maske cited a source close to the  situation as saying, coaches hope Johnson 
will return in time for  the team's November 26 meeting with Philadelphia at 
FedEx Field.  

Johnson told Maske yesterday that he has  every intention of playing again 
this season. 

""There's no doubt about that (he will  play again this season). I think it's 
a matter of when. The weeks  kind of go by fast. But we're still dealing with 
seven more games, a  bye week and the playoffs. Right now our team just has 
to find a way  to win, and I've got to find a way to get healthy. In time, 
then  we'll get back together."" 

Johnson said he would like to be ready to  play against the Rams, the 
defending Super Bowl champions. The  Redskins have 15 days between games 
because they have a bye the  weekend after Sunday's Arizona game. 

""We probably won't make a decision about  the St. Louis game until the 
Wednesday or Thursday before the game,""  Johnson said. ""I would like to play. 
I think that would be a great  game to be part of. The biggest decision isn't 
whether it's  (artificial) turf or grass. It's just being able to drop back 
and  being healthy enough to play a full game."" 

However, Maske's sources indicate the  Redskins are already planning for 
George to start against St. Louis  a week from this coming Monday. 

Team officials have described Johnson's  injury as a Grade 2 MCL sprain, but 
Maske's sources say the injury  is at the severe end of the Grade 2 range and 
actually borders on  being a Grade 3 sprain. 

A Grade 2 injury is defined as one in  which the tissue has been partially 
but not completely torn and  there is appreciable limitation in function. A 
Grade 3 injury is one  in which tissue has been significantly or completely 
torn or  disrupted and there is a virtually complete loss of function.  

NFL players regularly play with MCL  injuries. The risk players take by 
playing on damaged knees is that  they will suffer more severe knee injuries. 
Johnson said he knows  the risks but will play when he is able. 

""The biggest thing is, right now the  ligament is weak,"" he said. ""Obviously 
right now... It could worsen  very easily if I took a hit. There hasn't been 
a whole lot of  discussion about that. The biggest discussion now is how 
we're going  to treat it and get back as soon as possible. When I'm healthy  
enough to drop back and play, then I'll play that day."" 

Johnson says the fact he intends to test  the free agent market after the 
season won't be a factor in  determining when he plays again. 

""The most important thing for me is to be  able to drop back in the pocket,"" 
Johnson said. ""From that point on,  if I can drop back in the pocket, then 
I'll play. I'm not worried  about ever taking a hit. I've gone through 
injuries before. The  biggest thing to me is being healthy enough to play. 
I'm not worried  about a contract next year with anyone. I feel like my play 
overall,  and my history, will take care of itself."" 

Johnson was on the practice field  yesterday with his knee heavily wrapped. 
He moved little, made some  throws and mostly watched George and rookie 
quarterback Todd  Husak -- who has been elevated from third to second on the  
Redskins' depth chart -- at work. 

""I feel much better than I did Tuesday or  Wednesday,"" Johnson said. ""I can 
throw normal. There's no problem  there. I can do a lot of walking. I ride 
the (exercise) bike about  an hour a day. The problem is going lateral, side 
to side. As a  quarterback, that's what you do in the pocket. So I'm not able 
to  drop back at full speed and throw. But I'm better than I was earlier  in 
the week."" 

Other notes of interest out of Washington  this morning... 

Veteran fullback Larry  Centers comes off a productive game last Monday 
night,  catching six passes for 39 yards and a touchdown. Given the  
Redskins' injury problems at wide out, Centers could get a number of  looks 
out of the backfield this week against his old team, the  Cardinals. 

Although Albert Connell,  Irving Fryar and James Thrash are  all expected to 
play, the chances of any of them going full speed  are slim. 

Look for cornerback Champ  Bailey will see his most extensive playing time of 
the  season at wide receiver in order to provide a legitimate deep threat  to 
keep the Cards from focusing their all of their attention RB  Stephen Davis. 

Davis had 280 yards on 55 attempts in his  two games against the Cardinals in 
1999 and in what will be a  scaled-back game plan, he's likely to get 25-30 
carries against the  Cardinals' marshmallow-soft defensive front seven.

BRONCOS KNOW DAVIS IS CRUCIAL TO THEIR  SUCCESS...

This is it... It's time for Denver Broncos running back  Terrell Davis to 
make his second comeback of the  season against the Jets tomorrow. Unlike the 
season opener when all  eyes were on the veteran's surgically reconstructed 
right knee, this  time everybody will be watching Davis' badly sprained left 
foot and  ankle that get all the attention. 

The former University of Georgia star has  missed five of the last seven 
games -- including three in a row --  and has gained only 99 total yards on 
24 carries... 

Don't look for coaches to push Davis  incredibly hard in his first game back. 
In fact, Davis isn't sure  how much he might be capable of doing this week. 

""Let me just finish this game. If I can  finish this game I'll be the 
happiest man on this planet,"" Davis  said. ""If I can stay healthy, I know 
good things are going to  happen..."" 

And make no mistake about it: Keeping  Davis healthy becomes job number-one 
from here on out. Coaches are  certainly aware than whatever chances the team 
might have of making  a playoff run lie in having a healthy and productive 
Davis in the  mix. 

So the goal this week will be easing him  back into playing shape by giving 
him maybe 15 carries tomorrow with  Mike Anderson taking the rest... 

One factor working in Davis' favor  Howard Griffith's return to the lineup 
after  experiencing swelling in his surgically repaired left knee the last  
two weeks. The veteran fullback said it's all part of the process,  however, 
and has practiced full speed all week. 

""It's getting there. It's not going to be  100 percent until I'm not banging 
people anymore,"" he said...  

Bottom line on Davis? 

My expectations are high for him over the  remainder of the season, but I'm 
not sure I'd want to bank on a huge  game in his first week back... 

One last note out of Denver this  morning... Backup running back KaRon 
Coleman was  included on Friday's list of early inactives due to a sprained  
foot.

A RELIEVED JEFF GEORGE  READY TO FACE CARDINALS...

According to the Associated Press,  veteran quarterback Jeff George looked 
relieved and  relaxed after practice Friday. It was easier to concentrate on 
his  upcoming first start with the Washington Redskins knowing that his  
newborn baby was doing fine. 

""Thank God,"" George said. ""I think  whenever something goes wrong and it's 
your own, you worry. First  things first. My family's number-one in my life, 
and I got to take  care of them."" 

George is starting Sunday's game at  Arizona because Brad Johnson sprained a 
knee  ligament in Monday night's loss to Tennessee. But instead of  preparing 
full-tilt for his first action of the season, George  missed practice 
Wednesday when his wife delivered their third child.  

The next day, George was distracted by  news that the baby, Jayden Scott, had 
breathing  difficulties. It was only just before Thursday afternoon's 
practice  that he received word that the baby was fine. 

George, who earlier this season answered  ""dad"" when asked to give one word 
to describe himself, was confident  he could overcome the distractions and 
give a good performance  Sunday. 

""When you get some sort of news like we  did,"" George said, ""you take a back 
seat and say, `What's more  important?' But I've prepared myself. It hasn't 
been just this week,  I've been preparing the last 10 weeks. It's not a cram 
session. I've  been preparing from the get-go."" 

George signed a four-year, $18.25 million  contract in April to back up 
Johnson so he could have a shot at  playing for a Super Bowl team. He said he 
doesn't see Sunday's game  as an audition either to replace Johnson or to 
build interest in  other teams considering an off-season trade. 

""I think everybody knows what I can do,""  George said. ""We've got an injury, 
and I've got to carry the torch.  You hate to have to play under these 
circumstances. Brad's my  friend. I wish him well. I hope he recovers fast."" 

Johnson, who could miss two to four weeks  with the injury, is one of many 
ailing Redskins starters, including  wide receivers Irving Fryar and Albert  
Connell, who are likely to be less than full speed for  Sunday's game. 

""I probably feel the healthiest out of  anybody,"" George said. 

Coaches might have Skip  Hicks handle kickoff returns against the Cardinals 
this  Sunday in an attempt to lighten the workload for James  Thrash, who has 
been returning kickoffs and punts, starting  at wide receiver -- and -- 
playing on kickoff and punt coverage  teams...

""i haven't been able to get my arm pretty much all the way over the top or raise it all the way above my head to throw the ball. i've kind of been side-arming things just trying to get through practice so i could be the backup. i don't know what they are going to do. i want to back up, but that might not be in the best interest in the team (this week)."" head coach wade phillips said friday he would wait until pregame warm-ups sunday to decide whether johnson would be number-two or number-three against new england. although phillips wasn't willing to address the escalating tension between johnson and flutie, buffalo general manager john butler, speaking on the empire sports network, said he doesn't fear the team is in turmoil. ""i was at practice today and it looked like a football team preparing for the new england patriots,"" he said. ""i'll tell you, if you've been around sports, been in locker rooms, if you get 53 men together, not everybody is going to like everybody all the time. the key is to be respectful of one another and when it comes time to play, you play hard and play together. ""everybody isn't going to be walking hand in hand down the hallways, but we've got a team that's going to stick together and play their hearts out and that's all that matters. ""these are grown men. sometimes it's fun to even blow it up a little bit more than it is, and so be it. it's incumbent upon our team to stick together and they will,"" he said. ""i've been through this 150 times."" butler dismissed the si quotes because they had no attribution. ""if you want to say something and can't put your name to it, it bothers me,"" he said. ""you've got a problem somewhere so i don't put any substance to it."" stay tuned boys and girls... we haven't heard the last of this one... ? ///////////////////// ? ? redmond injures foot; pats likely to rely on faulk... [image] written by tfl report editor bob harris | posted saturday november 4, 2000 @ 11:55 pt [image] [image] [image] [image] [image] according to frank dell'apa of the boston globe, it looks like kevin faulk will be asked to carry running game when the new england patriots take on the buffalo bills tomorrow. faulk's opportunity comes at the expense of rookie j.r. redmond, who displaced faulk in the starting lineup with a 22-carry, 97-yard performance against the colts two weeks ago, but was downgraded to questionable on friday's injury report after hurting his foot in practice thursday. according to head coach bill belichick, redmond ""stepped on something at practice and wasn't able to do much (friday)."" ""i don't know if i'll be playing more,"" faulk said. ""whatever the game plan is, i'm ready every week."" faulk will be facing a difficult test this time. buffalo has surrendered 585 rushing yards, the second-lowest total in the nfl. ""all you have to do is check the stats,"" faulk said. ""teams don't average more than 3 yards a carry against them."" the patriots are averaging 3.4 yards per rush and faulk is averaging 3.7 yards per rush. ""it's always a challenge, but this time it's even more of a challenge because we are going against one of the best defenses in the league,"" faulk said. ""we can't expect to run over them, no. what we need is a balanced attack. if we can get that going and move the football, we should be all right."" faulk was on pace to gain more than 1,000 yards after four games but he has tailed off with a total of 171 yards in the last four games. but faulk is the team's leading all-purpose yardage player with 1,156 yards, an average of 7 yards each time he has the ball. team officials had hoped the redmond's ascension to the first team would allow faulk to concentrate on what most observers feel he is best suited for: third-down duty. as productive as he might have been the first half of the season, concerns over faulk's durability have been an issue from day one and belichick is convinced the former lsu standout's ability to run the ball effectively is inversely proportional to the number of time he carries it... other items of interest... after working extensively at wide receiver this week, tight end eric bjornson was included on the team's list of early inactives yesterday. and his chances of contributing to the offense in coming weeks don't sound very good after team officials indicated that rod rutledge will start at tight end for the remainder of the season... wide receiver terry glenn suffered a minor shoulder injury in practice, but he's listed as probable and coaches expect him to start and play as usual against the bills tomorrow. quarterback drew bledsoe missed thursday's practice in order to stay with his wife as she gave birth to the couple's third child. the veteran signal caller will start and play as usual tomorrow. ? //////////////////////// ? ? redskins' johnson has significant mcl tear... [image] written by tfl report editor bob harris | posted saturday november 4, 2000 @ 09:30 pt [image] [image] [image] [image] [image] mark maske of the washington post reported this morning that redskins quarterback brad johnson is suffering from a significant tear to the medial collateral ligament in his left knee that is relatively close to being a complete tear. maske went on to write, ""even when his mcl heals sufficiently for him to resume playing, johnson will face the risk of suffering a more severe knee injury by playing on the damaged joint. he will have to decide how much risk to take playing for a team he might leave via free agency in the offseason, at a time when his contract is about to expire and he has no guaranteed income beyond this season. ""as he exited redskins park yesterday, johnson acknowledged the increased risks but said he plans to play again this season and will make his decisions based solely upon his physical readiness to play, not upon future financial considerations. he said the timetable for his return is unclear, but he refused to rule out the possibility of playing in the st. louis game."" team officials expect johnson to miss that november 20 meeting with the rams. of course, the former viking has already been ruled out for tomorrow's game against arizona and jeff george will make his first appearance with washington's first team offense this season. maske cited a source close to the situation as saying, coaches hope johnson will return in time for the team's november 26 meeting with philadelphia at fedex field. johnson told maske yesterday that he has every intention of playing again this season. ""there's no doubt about that (he will play again this season). i think it's a matter of when. the weeks kind of go by fast. but we're still dealing with seven more games, a bye week and the playoffs. right now our team just has to find a way to win, and i've got to find a way to get healthy. in time, then we'll get back together."" johnson said he would like to be ready to play against the rams, the defending super bowl champions. the redskins have 15 days between games because they have a bye the weekend after sunday's arizona game. ""we probably won't make a decision about the st. louis game until the wednesday or thursday before the game,"" johnson said. ""i would like to play. i think that would be a great game to be part of. the biggest decision isn't whether it's (artificial) turf or grass. it's just being able to drop back and being healthy enough to play a full game."" however, maske's sources indicate the redskins are already planning for george to start against st. louis a week from this coming monday. team officials have described johnson's injury as a grade 2 mcl sprain, but maske's sources say the injury is at the severe end of the grade 2 range and actually borders on being a grade 3 sprain. a grade 2 injury is defined as one in which the tissue has been partially but not completely torn and there is appreciable limitation in function. a grade 3 injury is one in which tissue has been significantly or completely torn or disrupted and there is a virtually complete loss of function. nfl players regularly play with mcl injuries. the risk players take by playing on damaged knees is that they will suffer more severe knee injuries. johnson said he knows the risks but will play when he is able. ""the biggest thing is, right now the ligament is weak,"" he said. ""obviously right now... it could worsen very easily if i took a hit. there hasn't been a whole lot of discussion about that. the biggest discussion now is how we're going to treat it and get back as soon as possible. when i'm healthy enough to drop back and play, then i'll play that day."" johnson says the fact he intends to test the free agent market after the season won't be a factor in determining when he plays again. ""the most important thing for me is to be able to drop back in the pocket,"" johnson said. ""from that point on, if i can drop back in the pocket, then i'll play. i'm not worried about ever taking a hit. i've gone through injuries before. the biggest thing to me is being healthy enough to play. i'm not worried about a contract next year with anyone. i feel like my play overall, and my history, will take care of itself."" johnson was on the practice field yesterday with his knee heavily wrapped. he moved little, made some throws and mostly watched george and rookie quarterback todd husak -- who has been elevated from third to second on the redskins' depth chart -- at work. ""i feel much better than i did tuesday or wednesday,"" johnson said. ""i can throw normal. there's no problem there. i can do a lot of walking. i ride the (exercise) bike about an hour a day. the problem is going lateral, side to side. as a quarterback, that's what you do in the pocket. so i'm not able to drop back at full speed and throw. but i'm better than i was earlier in the week."" other notes of interest out of washington this morning... veteran fullback larry centers comes off a productive game last monday night, catching six passes for 39 yards and a touchdown. given the redskins' injury problems at wide out, centers could get a number of looks out of the backfield this week against his old team, the cardinals. although albert connell, irving fryar and james thrash are all expected to play, the chances of any of them going full speed are slim. look for cornerback champ bailey will see his most extensive playing time of the season at wide receiver in order to provide a legitimate deep threat to keep the cards from focusing their all of their attention rb stephen davis. davis had 280 yards on 55 attempts in his two games against the cardinals in 1999 and in what will be a scaled-back game plan, he's likely to get 25-30 carries against the cardinals' marshmallow-soft defensive front seven. ? ///////////////////////// ? ? [image] broncos know davis is crucial to their success... [image] written by tfl report editor bob harris | posted saturday november 4, 2000 @ 08:00 pt [image] [image] [image] [image] [image] this is it... it's time for denver broncos running back terrell davis to make his second comeback of the season against the jets tomorrow. unlike the season opener when all eyes were on the veteran's surgically reconstructed right knee, this time everybody will be watching davis' badly sprained left foot and ankle that get all the attention. the former university of georgia star has missed five of the last seven games -- including three in a row -- and has gained only 99 total yards on 24 carries... don't look for coaches to push davis incredibly hard in his first game back. in fact, davis isn't sure how much he might be capable of doing this week. ""let me just finish this game. if i can finish this game i'll be the happiest man on this planet,"" davis said. ""if i can stay healthy, i know good things are going to happen..."" and make no mistake about it: keeping davis healthy becomes job number-one from here on out. coaches are certainly aware than whatever chances the team might have of making a playoff run lie in having a healthy and productive davis in the mix. so the goal this week will be easing him back into playing shape by giving him maybe 15 carries tomorrow with mike anderson taking the rest... one factor working in davis' favor howard griffith's return to the lineup after experiencing swelling in his surgically repaired left knee the last two weeks. the veteran fullback said it's all part of the process, however, and has practiced full speed all week. ""it's getting there. it's not going to be 100 percent until i'm not banging people anymore,"" he said... bottom line on davis? my expectations are high for him over the remainder of the season, but i'm not sure i'd want to bank on a huge game in his first week back... one last note out of denver this morning... backup running back karon coleman was included on friday's list of early inactives due to a sprained foot. ? /////////////////////////// ? ? a relieved jeff george ready to face cardinals... [image] written by tfl report editor bob harris | posted friday november 3, 2000 @ 15:05 pt [image] [image] [image] [image] [image] according to the associated press, veteran quarterback jeff george looked relieved and relaxed after practice friday. it was easier to concentrate on his upcoming first start with the washington redskins knowing that his newborn baby was doing fine. ""thank god,"" george said. ""i think whenever something goes wrong and it's your own, you worry. first things first. my family's number-one in my life, and i got to take care of them."" george is starting sunday's game at arizona because brad johnson sprained a knee ligament in monday night's loss to tennessee. but instead of preparing full-tilt for his first action of the season, george missed practice wednesday when his wife delivered their third child. the next day, george was distracted by news that the baby, jayden scott, had breathing difficulties. it was only just before thursday afternoon's practice that he received word that the baby was fine. george, who earlier this season answered ""dad"" when asked to give one word to describe himself, was confident he could overcome the distractions and give a good performance sunday. ""when you get some sort of news like we did,"" george said, ""you take a back seat and say, `what's more important?' but i've prepared myself. it hasn't been just this week, i've been preparing the last 10 weeks. it's not a cram session. i've been preparing from the get-go."" george signed a four-year, $18.25 million contract in april to back up johnson so he could have a shot at playing for a super bowl team. he said he doesn't see sunday's game as an audition either to replace johnson or to build interest in other teams considering an off-season trade. ""i think everybody knows what i can do,"" george said. ""we've got an injury, and i've got to carry the torch. you hate to have to play under these circumstances. brad's my friend. i wish him well. i hope he recovers fast."" johnson, who could miss two to four weeks with the injury, is one of many ailing redskins starters, including wide receivers irving fryar and albert connell, who are likely to be less than full speed for sunday's game. ""i probably feel the healthiest out of anybody,"" george said. coaches might have skip hicks handle kickoff returns against the cardinals this sunday in an attempt to lighten the workload for james thrash, who has been returning kickoffs and punts, starting at wide receiver -- and -- playing on kickoff and punt coverage teams... ////////////////////// ? great stuff as always from bob.? for more information on how to subscribe to the tfl report, check out i've been a subscriber for years. ? ? to unsubscribe from this group, send an email - 0.gif",1,Personal & Brief Work Messages,Mass Marketing & Promotional Mailings
